<h2>Background/Rationale of the paper</h2>
<div>
<p>It is widely recognized that parental involvement and engagement supports children’s educational achievement. The researchers of this study were interested in exploring what parents feel about the schools’ strategies for involving and engaging parents in their child’s IEP. The researchers interviewed parents from 31 families in 11 schools across Ontario. The families had children with a range of characteristics, but all of the children had IEPs.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Most of the parents were involved in one of the following ways in their child’s IEP:  they served as volunteers in their child’s classroom; they helped their child with homework; they received and read the documents and report cards related to the child’s IEP; and they met with and talked to the child’s various teachers. Although most of these activities were initiated by the school and parents were primarily recipients of information in relation to the development and implementation of the IEP, the parents appeared satisfied with the relationship.  The researchers suggest that such activities are more passive forms of involvement in the child’s IEP.  &#13;<p />&#13;<p />When parents felt that the school was not meeting their child’s unique needs, the parents took on a more active approach to engaging with the school system.
