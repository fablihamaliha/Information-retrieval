<h2>BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING PROGRAM OVERVIEW</h2>

<p class="cta-cite">
  Ryerson's Biomedical Engineering program is one of the first standalone undergraduate Biomedical Engineering programs in Canada. Biomedical engineering is an innovative field that integrates physical, chemical, mathematical and computational sciences and engineering principles to study biology, medicine, behaviour, and health.</p>

<p  align="right"><img src="images/banneredp2015headimaging copy_thumbnail.png"></p>
<div class="pullquote">&ldquo;The Biomedical Engineering program has been developed to benefit from, enhance and expand the multidisciplinary collaboration among the various engineering and science programs at Ryerson.&rdquo;</div>

<p>The Faculty  of Engineering and Architectural Science (<a href="http://www.feas.ryerson.ca/">FEAS</a>) through the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering offers the BEng in Biomedical Engineering four-year degree program. The Bachelor of Engineering, Biomedical Engineering program is accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). Our Biomedical Engineering program aims to take advantage of the strategic location of Ryerson University in proximity to Toronto's Discovery District and seven world-class hospitals.</p>

<p> The Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering in collaboration with the Departments of Aerospace Engineering, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Industrial and Mechanical Engineering, and Mathematics at Ryerson University will deliver the curriculum.
</p>


<p>According to the working definition of the National Institutes of Health (<small>NIH</small>), biomedical engineering integrates physical, chemical, mathematical and computational sciences and engineering principles to study biology, medicine, behaviour, and health. It advances fundamental concepts, creates knowledge from the molecular to the organ system levels, and develops innovative biologics, materials, processes, implants, devices and informatics approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease; for patient rehabilitation; and for improving health.
</p>

<div class="pullquote">&ldquo;Our Biomedical Engineering program aims to take advantage of the strategic location of Ryerson University in proximity to Toronto's Discovery District and seven world-class hospitals.&rdquo;</div>

<p>The Biomedical Engineering program has been developed to benefit from, enhance and expand the multidisciplinary collaboration among the various engineering and science programs at Ryerson; to attract more students of higher quality to the university and retain them, as well as enhance the reputation of engineering education at Ryerson. It will offer students excellent opportunities to build strong backgrounds in biomedical engineering and benefit from the collaborative interdisciplinary relationships between engineering and life sciences, being key strategic areas of strength at FEAS, Ryerson. The Faculty has expertise in almost all of the areas of biomedical engineering. At this point the expertise is primarily devoted to the research activities of the faculty members.</p>

<p>
This program is run within the framework of engineering programs at Ryerson. As with all degree programs associated with engineering, students are initially admitted into the common first year for engineering. During the second year students will study fundamental courses in electronic circuits, biomaterials, cell biology, physiology, engineering algorithms, digital systems, statics and mechanics of materials. In third year the students will focus in microprocessor systems, fluid mechanics, biomedical transducers, bioinformatics, biomechanics, biostatistics, signals and systems, control systems, and biomedical instrumentation. In the fourth year, the students will study a range of state-of-the-art topics in biomedical engineering, and will also be involved in a <a href="/capstone">Capstone Design Project</a>.
</p>


<h3>CAREERS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING</h3>
<p>
There is a growing need for engineers trained in the biomedical sciences. Biomedical engineers are employed in industry, in hospitals, in research facilities of educational and medical institutions, in teaching, and in government regulatory agencies. They often serve a coordinating or interfacing function, using their background in both the engineering and medical fields. In industry, they may create designs where an in-depth understanding of living systems and of technology is essential. They may be involved in performance testing of new or proposed products. Government positions often involve product testing and safety, as well as establishing safety standards for devices. In the hospital, the biomedical engineer may provide advice on the selection and use of medical equipment, as well as supervising its performance testing and maintenance. They may also build customized devices for special health care or research needs. In research institutions, biomedical engineers supervise laboratories and equipment, and participate in or direct research activities in collaboration with other researchers with such backgrounds as medicine, physiology, and nursing. The number of biomedical engineering jobs will climb almost twice as fast as the overall engineering discipline average for a 26.1 percent gain by 2012, according to the U.S. government's new long-range forecast.

<h3><a name="transition"></a>TRANSITION PROGRAM</h3>

<p>First Year Transition Program: The objective of the first year transition program is to provide students, who may need more time to adapt to the demanding university curriculum, with an immediate opportunity to upgrade their Academic Standing. In the second semester, Phase I of the transition program offers all first semester core courses: CHY 102, MTH 140, MTH 141, and PCS 211 in parallel with the second semester regular program courses. Students who have failed and/or are missing any one of these courses at the end of the first semester are required to upgrade their Academic Standing through enrolling in the transition program. During the condensed Spring semester (May-July) Phase II of the transition program offers all second semester core courses: AER 222, BME 100, CHE 200, CHY 211, CPS 125, CVL 207, ELE 202, MEC 222, MTH 240, MTL 200, and PCS 125. These courses represent a repeat of the second semester regular program courses that were not taken by students enrolled in Phase I of the transition program. These courses will be offered subject to adequate enrolment.</p>

  <p>At the completion of the transition program, successful transition program students will be promoted to the second year of the Biomedical Engineering program, without losing an academic year.</p>

<h3><a name="EIP"></a>EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM</h3>

<p>Highly innovative and proactive retention strategies play an important role in helping students build the skills for success in a demanding engineering curriculum. Through the First-Year  Engineering Office, the Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Science has incorporated the Early Intervention Program into the first-year engineering experience. At the semester's mid-point, students who are failing courses in their core curriculum are identified and encouraged to attend an interview with the First-Year  Engineering Program Director/Academic Advisor and/or the Student Counsellor. Together, the student and the academic support team members discuss options to help reduce the chances of academic failure.</p>

They may also build customized devices for special health care or research needs.&rdquo;</div>



 <h3>COMMUNICATIONS PROFICIENCY AND WRITING SKILLS</h3>
 
							<p> All new engineering students are automatically enrolled in CEN 199: Writing Skills.</p>

							<p> CEN 199 is graded on a Pass/Fail basis, and is used to track the results of the Writing Skills Test (WST) and/or Ryerson Test of English Proficiency (RTEP).</p>

							<p> All students admitted into engineering, except those who wrote the RTEP and achieved a grade B' or higher, are required to write the mandatory Writing Skills Test (WST) during Orientation Week. Students who pass the WST (by achieving a grade B' or higher) or the RTEP (by achieving a grade B' or higher) will receive a PASS in CEN 199 and therefore may enrol in the lower level liberal studies course of their choice (subject to availability).</p>

							<p> Students who do not pass the WST, or achieved C' level remedial pass on the RTEP, will receive an INP (In Progress Grade) in CEN 199 and will be required to enrol in one of LNG 111, LNG 112, LNG 113, or LNG 121 as their first-year lower level liberal studies course. These courses, which count towards lower level liberal studies requirements, are writing-intensive humanities and social science courses designed to give students the opportunity to strengthen their foundations in communication. These students will then have three additional opportunities to write and pass the WST:</p>

							<ul class="normal">
							  <li> In May, following Semester 2.</li>
							  <li> During Orientation Week prior to Semester 3.</li>
							  <li> In May, following Semester 4.</li>
							</ul>

							<p><br/> <b>A PASS in CEN 199: Writing Skills is required to enrol in all third-year engineering courses</b>. Students with a grade of INP in CEN 199 will not be allowed to enrol in any third-year engineering course.</p>

							<p> Detailed information is available from the First-Year and Common Engineering Office. Room ENG 377 Telephone: 416-979-5000 ext. 4261.</p>
