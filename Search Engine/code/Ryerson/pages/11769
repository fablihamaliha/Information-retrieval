<p><strong>CC8982 (CMCT 6118 3.0) The Body and the Culture of Modernity</strong><br> In the later half of the twentieth century, the body emerged as a topic that attracted the efforts of many artists who were committed to some form of cultural critique. Many recent artists have revolted against the modern body – the mechanized, regimented, controlled and profoundly unfree body. They have strived to move beyond the culture of modernity by creating a Dionysian body culture that is life-affirming, a culture that expresses bodily energies and passions, a culture that will bind people together in shared cultural experiences of ecstasy and intoxication. They have strived to dissolve the individual ego in collective ecstasy and sensual surrender.

<p><strong>CC9904 (CMCT 7000 3.0) Perspectives in Commun. &amp; Cultural Studies</strong><br> [formerly Advanced Theories in Communication &amp; Culture I] This course provides an advanced exploration of the major theories and research approaches in the field, with particular attention to a critical assessment of contemporary theories and methods. The first segment of the course will introduce students to those classical theorists and philosophers whose work was taken up and developed by more recent studies in the late twentieth century. It therefore deliberately anticipates issues that were subsequently developed so that students may be equipped to decide in the second part of the course which themes are relevant or irrelevant to the study of communication and culture. Doctoral Course. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CC9906 (CMCT 7005 3.0) PhD Field Seminar: Disciplinary Practices</strong><br> This seminar facilitates independent doctoral research by developing skills of disciplinary rigour in relation to individual research interests. It provides guidance in the advancement of field and area specialties in preparation for comprehensive qualifying exams, dissertation proposal, and ethics review process. It includes theories and practices of critical pedagogy and praxis, academic and professional publication, and other elements of professional research. Antirequisite: CC9903. 1 Credit.</p> 
<p><strong>CC9920 (CMCT 7120 3.0) Selected Topics in Psychoanalysis and Culture</strong><br> This course will survey some of the key concepts of Freudian and post-Freudian theory and assess their value in the study of culture and society. The course will then present an overview of some of the ways that psychoanalytic theory has been used in the study of culture. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CC9921 (CMCT 7500 3.0) Technology, Communication and Culture</strong><br> Employing the insights of the Toronto school and related theories, this course explores culture and technology as productive processes, with emphasis on the historical development of communication technologies and their influence on culture and society. Doctoral Foundation Course. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CC9922 (CMCT 7125 3.0) Cinema and Media: Key Concepts</strong><br> The course will explore key concepts, texts and debates in the field of contemporary cinema and media studies. A central focus of course will be on the intellectual and material histories of cinema studies and media studies as disciplines (and their recent convergence), including the development of different models of film study (film as art, culture, sociological force, industry, etc); the development of classical film theory and film criticism; semiotics and feminist film theory; the historical turn; and the mutual influence of other disciplines in relation to the study of cinema and media. Antirequisite: FILM 7000 3.0 (York University) 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CC9990 (CMCT 7011 3.0) Directed Readings A</strong><br> A directed readings course is intended to permit the student to survey a coherent body of literature in an area of study related to the student’s program objectives. Doctoral Course. 1 Credit</p>

<p><strong>CC9992 (CMCT 7002 3.0) Directed Research</strong><br> A directed research course is intended to permit the student to conduct research or develop a theoretical perspective in an area of study related to the student’s program objectives. The research may take the form of a pilot study for a thesis or dissertation project. Doctoral Course. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CC9993 (CMCT 7003 3.0) Directed Group Study</strong><br> Under this heading, a group of students, with the agreement of a faculty member, may organize a seminar in an area not covered in the course offerings. Doctoral Course. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>COMMUNICATION AND DESIGN COURSES</strong></p> 
<p><strong>CD8310 Topics in Cross Cultural Comm</strong><br> The term cross-cultural competence denotes a vast complex of competencies, which educators, politicians and business leaders around the world have identified as one of the most crucial of the 21st century. The purpose of this course will be to foster such "competence" through a wide-ranging examination of the major social issues that affect communication across national and cultural boundaries. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CD8320 Media Lang: Forms, Approaches</strong><br> This interdisciplinary course will investigate both common elements (visual and auditory narratives, methods of presentation/distribution, cultural roles) and specific attributes (individual characteristics and technologies) of contemporary media forms. Key developments in the evolution of media types and media languages will be explored in the larger context of understanding critical and theoretical issues associated with these forms and languages. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CD8330 Audiences and the Public</strong><br> The course addresses the challenges concerning value creation and the effective design and delivery of media/mediated products and services from the perspective of the audience. The course brings an interdisciplinary conceptual framework to bear on contemporary media and mediated consumption to investigate five principal ways of audiencing (citizen, spectator, customer, user and player) as well as the new audience sociability and several key issues around managing it: metrics, presumption, fans, transmedia, and business models. 1 Credit.</p> 
<p><strong>CD8340 Media Writing: Critical &amp; Narrative Forms</strong><br> This course will explore issues of form, expression and viewpoint in writing for contemporary visual arts and media. The emphasis will be on essays and critical studies, but writing of summaries, proposals and analyses will also be covered. Traditions of literary and arts criticism form a basis for study of contemporary writing practices for both print and screen-based media. 1 Credit</p> 
<p><strong>CD8350 Socially Engaged Media</strong><br> Bringing together masters students in Social Work and Documentary Media, this research/creation seminar explores socially engaged practices which privilege collaboration and social interaction in an interdisciplinary dialogue. These practices adopt and borrow from such disciplines as pedagogy, theatre, ethnography, anthropology, art and social work. Through praxis we will explore common methodological problems faced by researchers and practitioners in relation to their subjects and communities. 1 Credit.</p> 
<p><strong>CD8351 Documentary as Oppositional Practice</strong><br> This course will focus on contemporary documentary practices and aesthetic strategies employed by Indigenous, racialized, feminist and LGBT media artists and filmmakers to communicate alternate discourses and diverse perspectives. Drawing upon feminist studies, queer studies, and critical race studies, it will examine the ways in which visual documentary media have been effectively deployed to address issues of identity, power, difference and representation. 1 Credit</p>
