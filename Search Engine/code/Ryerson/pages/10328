<p>Note: All applicants to Grades-Plus programs in the Faculty of Communication and Design, and the Architectural Science program, are required to pay a Non-Academic Requirements Fee of $50 per program.&nbsp; The fee is paid at the time of submission of the Non-Academic Requirements.&nbsp; Please visit the applicable <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/programs/undergraduate/" target="_blank">Program</a></span> page for details.</p> 
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Communications</span></p> 
<p><strong>Ryerson’s primary mode of communication is the Choose&gt;Ryerson portal and email.</strong></p> 
<p>All applicants are required to use a Choose&gt;Ryerson portal account (<span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="http://choose.ryerson.ca" target="_blank">choose.ryerson.ca</a></span>), and will be sent personal log in details to their email account after their application has been received.<br /> <br /> Application status and applicant communications are viewable in the Choose&gt;Ryerson portal. Applicants must regularly monitor their Choose&gt;Ryerson account, and read all of the information that is posted to the 'My Application Status' and 'Documents' sections. Applicants are strongly advised to print and save all communications posted to their Choose&gt;Ryerson portal account.<br /> <br /> If an applicant’s email address changes, Ryerson must be updated immediately, through appropriate channels. Applicants should ensure that they have edited/updated their 'spam' filters to prevent important and time-sensitive e-mail communications from being filtered out as spam.</p> 
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Application Changes/Updates</span></p> 
<p>Applicants may review and change their completed application once it has been submitted. If any revisions to the OUAC application are made, Ryerson will be notified of the applicable changes shortly after the submission to the OUAC. Although all changes are important to the processing of each application, changes to program choice, surname, mailing, e-mail and home addresses are of significant importance and should be reported to the OUAC as soon as the situation arises.</p> 
<p>Applicants who have applied via the Ryerson Application must notify Undergraduate Admissions of any changes in application, address, e-mail, telephone numbers and/or other information as soon as they arise using the Ryerson Change Form, available on the <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/applications-related-forms/" target="_blank">Applications and Related Forms</a></span> page.</p> 
<p>For applicants that have applied to Ryerson in a previous academic year: if the name on the application has changed in any way, proof of this name change (i.e. marriage certificate, notarized statement or other legal document) must be provided.&nbsp; Applicants must submit their legal name on the application; short forms or nick names should not be used.&nbsp; Applicants using the OUAC applications will be given the option to include their preferred name(s) in a separate field.<br /> <br /> NOTE: Changes (e.g. to application/amendments/condition extensions, etc.) may not be made verbally, either in person or by telephone. Most communication from Ryerson is date sensitive. Applicants who fail to respond within stated time frames may have their application or Offer of Admission cancelled.<br /> </p></div>

Academic transcripts must be submitted regardless if the program of study was successfully completed, or is relevant to the current application.<br /> </li> 
 <li>A completed Ryerson Supplementary Form (OUAC 101 applicants are not required to submit this form).<br /> </li> 
 <li>Non-academic requirements (i.e. portfolios, essays, etc.) as applicable.<br /> </li> 
 <li>English language proficiency test scores as required (see <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/undergraduate/admission/english.html" target="_blank">English Language Requirements</a></span>).</li>

<p>All documents are routinely verified. Evidence of falsified documents during or after the admission selection process will result in the cancellation of an offer of admission and any/all program/course enrolments.

<p>Academic transcripts and all other supporting documentation submitted to Ryerson cannot be returned to the applicant.</p>

 <li>Applicants who have indicated on their application that they are in Canada on a 'Study Permit' or 'Temporary Resident Visa' must submit a copy of their Visa authorization form or 'immigration papers' confirming this status.</li> 
 <li>If applying for advanced standing admission (a level higher than first year/semester), course descriptions and teaching outlines of all post-secondary studies are generally not required at the time of application for admission (if this information is needed, a request will be forwarded by Undergraduate Admissions). Course/teaching outlines may be required after admission has been granted when the student is applying for transfer credit. Course/teaching outlines are not kept once a transfer credit decision is made. Students are encouraged to keep a copy of all course/teaching outlines for their records.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Internationally Educated Applicants</span></p> 
<p>Applicants are required to arrange for the submission of academic transcripts of all secondary and post-secondary studies (including promotion/graduation status), as well as school profile(s) including accreditation information and grading scale(s). Applicants must have already completed or be in the process of completing the minimum academic requirements at the time of application submission. If the documents are in a language other than English, applicants must also provide notarized literal English translations.</p> 
<p>Ontario universities (including Ryerson) may require undergraduate applicants to have official international academic transcripts submitted directly to World Education Services (WES) Canada for verification as part of the admission process.&nbsp; Universities (including Ryerson) will directly notify applicants submitting international academic transcripts regarding specific submission requirements through WES Canada.</p>

Non-Academic Requirements must be submitted to the appropriate program department, or Undergraduate Admissions, as per the instructions noted in the individual <a target="_blank" href="/programs/undergraduate/">Program</a> pages.<br /> <br /> <strong></strong>Ryerson requires applicants to upload their documents, where applicable, via our <a target="_blank" href="/admissions/undergraduate/apply/document-submission/">Document Upload page</a>. In extenuating circumstances, if applicants are unable to upload documents, they should be submitted by mail/courier to Ryerson University, Undergraduate Admissions, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON Canada M5B 2K3.</p> 
<p>All academic transcripts received via the Document Upload Page are considered <strong>unofficial</strong>. If offered admission, official academic transcripts must be provided as detailed in the Offer letter and sent using the OUAC Transcript Request Form, or by mail in a sealed envelope directly from the issuing institution. <strong>Maintaining an Offer of Admission will be dependent on the receipt and verification of official documents, in addition to meeting/fulfilling all other conditions stated in the Offer letter.&nbsp;</strong> To ensure documents are received by applicable deadlines, it is essential that applicants make all the necessary arrangements for the submission of required official academic transcripts well in advance of the deadline date stated in the Offer of Admission.<br /> </p> 
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Ontario University, College and Secondary School Transcripts</span></p> 
<p>Applicants who are attending or have previously attended an Ontario university or college can request academic transcripts via the Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) Transcript Request Form (TRF). Some exceptions apply. See the OUAC Instruction Booklet for details.<br /> </p> 
<p>Certain secondary schools in Ontario allow applicants to request official secondary school transcripts electronically (completed courses only) using an online service hosted by the Ontario College Application Service (OCAS). The OUAC has partnered with OCAS to offer this service to university applicants and it can be accessed from the Transcript Request section in the online OUAC 105 application. If the secondary school is not included in this online service, the secondary school must be contacted by the applicant to arrange for the submission of the official academic transcript.Ryerson University reserves the right to require official documents at any time during the application/admission process, and to rescind any Offer of Admission if discrepancies are found between unofficial and official documents.</p> 
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Important Notes</span></p> 
<p>All application information and documentation provided in support of an application must be true, accurate, complete, and have been prepared entirely by the applicant. No relevant information, academic or otherwise, can be withheld. Applicants may be required to provide documentation to the University to substantiate an application and the University has the authority to verify any information provided. Any misrepresentation of information may cause an application/admission/enrollment to be cancelled by the University at any time (see Ryerson's Academic Code of Conduct). It is each applicant's responsibility to read the information posted in the <a href="/admissions/undergraduate/after-applying/" target="_blank">After Applying</a> section of the Ryerson website, and understand the policies and procedures as noted.<br /> </p></div>

Requests received after these dates will be considered subject to space availability. There is no guarantee that a student will be able to transfer to another program. Students requesting a transfer will compete with all other candidates for admission and consideration is subject to space.</p> 
<p>Students are advised that they can have formal status in only one Ryerson degree program (including Special Student studies) at any given time. When a student confirms acceptance of an offer to transfer from one Ryerson program to another, and is matriculated to the new program, the student forfeits their status in the original program.</p> 
<p>Students who have a REQUIRED TO WITHDRAW (RTW) Standing, may not transfer to ANY Ryerson program until 12 months have elapsed following the RTW Standing (regardless of program). As well, no courses taken at Ryerson (or elsewhere) within this 12 month period will be granted Ryerson credit, except courses completed as part of the Student Success Program (Fresh Start).</p> 
<p>Students cannot apply to transfer to ANY Ryerson program immediately after receiving PERMANENT PROGRAM WITHDRAWAL Standing. Students may only apply to a different program for the fall semester of the following calendar year (regardless of program).<br /> </p></div>

<div class="text"><p>Course(s) taken as a Special Student, which an applicant subsequently wants to apply as transfer credit to a program, will not be recorded as a graded course nor will it be used in the calculation of the student’s Grade Point Average (GPA).<br /> <br /> While approval as a 'Special Student' permits students to attempt to enrol for individual courses, it does not guarantee and is not meant to guarantee enrolment in courses, or admission to a Ryerson program. Prospective Special Students should note that, for some courses, no space will be available to Special Students as preference is given to full-time program students.<br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE: </strong>Access to a course(s) is subject to approval of the teaching department. Approval may not be granted until after the commencement of term, as space is an essential consideration. Individual faculty members may not grant access to courses.</p> 
<p>Special Students are subject to the same continuation requirements as students in degree, diploma or certificate programs (see Academic Standings section). Special Students are normally permitted to enrol for one to two courses per semester unless they are studying on Letter of Permission from another university or have previously completed a degree from an accredited university.<br /> <br /> </p></div>
