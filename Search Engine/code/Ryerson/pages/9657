	<p>Hilary Dean is from Richmond Hill, Ontario and currently resides in Toronto’s Cabbagetown. She has a BFA in Film Studies from Ryerson University, and was the recipient of the Norman Jewison filmmaker award and the Natalie McDonald memorial award. Dean teaches a film course titled, “Re-framing Disability,” and recently received a grant from the Reva Gerstein Legacy Fund for her current project exploring mental illness and recovery.&nbsp; She is the mother of a five-year-old Jedi knight, and has been writing the same novel for 10 years.</p> 
<h4>So You’re Going Crazy…</h4> 
<p>Having suffered from mental illness, I know how terrifying, bewildering, and isolating the experience can be. Even after years of recovery, I continue my attempts to somehow process it. Because the subject is frightening to people, and carries with it a deeply entrenched cultural stigma, few people want to talk about “going crazy.”</p> 
<p>In my experience, talking to others who have been through similar trauma was what helped me the most. Their stories gave me hope and a sense of connection at a time when I felt very much alone. I tried to make my film in the spirit of support and collaboration, and was extremely lucky to have met such amazing, lovely people who were willing to speak openly about their experiences. I hope that this film will provide an understanding of the internal experience of mental illness, and offer some new insights for anyone who relates to it directly.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Tara Ernst is a Winnipeg born filmmaker and multi-media artist, currently completing her Master’s Degree in Fine Arts at Ryerson University. Ernst holds a joint undergraduate degree from Concordia University in Film Production and Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in Intermedia. Focusing her research primarily in cinema and media studies, Ernst’s work explores the complex nature of memory, history and nostalgia, examining the problematic manner in which dominant cultural institutions govern the way in which we recall our personal and cultural past.</p> 
<h4>Nostalgia for an Unknown Land</h4> 
<p>In the performance installation Nostalgia for an Unknown Land we have chosen to use the metaphorical meaning of the boat to explore the duality of nostalgia as both a desire to escape from and a yearning to return to one’s perceived idea of home.</p> 
<p>Caught on an irreconcilable ocean of longing, we attempt a re-enactment, to find or lose ourselves in each other’s respective countries: Germany and Canada. Through personal reflections and childhood memories, Nostalgia for an Unknown Land offers a mythical journey that explores the irreconcilability of nostalgia and its complex relationship to our utopian dreams of a better place, be it past or future, somewhere we’ve been or some place we long to go.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Remembering Inninimowin:&nbsp; The Cree Language, The Language of the Human Beings</h4> 
<p>Inninimowin is spoken in several Native communities across Canada.&nbsp; Although it is considered one of the most preserved Native languages; it is also at risk of disappearing.&nbsp; The language is the vehicle for carrying forth our traditional knowledge, customary laws, identity, spirituality, as well as the arts. Inninimowin holds the sacred stories, ceremonial practices and ancient teaching of the land and the Inninuwak.</p> 
<p>In a direct act of cultural genocide against Native peoples, the Canadian government, with the aid of the church are responsible for violently imposing the Indian Act, Reserve and Residential School systems on Native peoples leaving a detrimental impact on our communities, shattering our identities and way of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a peoples, we did not let our language and culture lapse, we were severed from them and we are now in the process of remembering and putting the pieces of our culture back together.</p> 
<p>Consequently, in both rural and urban Native communities, fewer people are using Inninimowin, which poses major challenges for the future of the Inninuwak nationwide. Yet with growing and changing perspectives towards how to preserve the truth of our identities come new ideas and approaches.&nbsp; Self-representation and regaining control over our misrepresented images in the mass media can result in positive change by breaking down racial barriers and facing stereotypes dead on. Using the medium of documentary film, I have explored the Inninuwak experience of sustaining Inninuwon from inside the communities, from an Inninu perspective. This film seeks to mend the gaps in understanding between generations by exposing the harsh treatment of Native peoples and moving towards reconciliation and healing.</p>

<h4>Secret Selves</h4> 
<p>Secret Selves is a photographic and audio documentary focusing on four disabled residents living in a group home. Using sound, this project goes beyond stereotypical charity imagery and engages the viewer in a multi-sensory experience. Audio, layered with photographs, produces a complex depiction of the lives of these individuals. The multiple and sequential presentation of the images echoes a filmstrip, calling attention to the inability to know someone through a single photograph. These sequences along with the accompanying soundtrack provide a larger window into the complex, secret, and often misunderstood lives of the disabled.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Secret Selves depicts the lives of Richard, Mary, Michael, and Rosemary. Empathetic in nature, this project allows the viewer to engage with the residents and recognize some fundamental differences between disabled and non-disabled lives. The audience is also provoked into exploring its own reactions and feelings, and perhaps facing prejudices or fears relating to the disabled. Just as the images take both a broad and intimate view of the subjects’ living space and daily lives, the audio includes personal conversations and public dialogue. Secret Selves presents the viewer with a glimpse into the personal space of these four individuals, hoping to offer new insights, while recognizing the limitations of media to translate lived experience.</p>

<h4>Weston Public</h4> 
<p>Weston Public is a site-specific collaborative research project that investigates the complexity of youth experience in public space in Weston-Mount Dennis, Toronto.</p> 
<p>The project brings together architecture and documentary film as a form of spatial and social practice. Weston Public was made in collaboration with Mariangela Piccione, a graduate student in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Toronto.</p> 
<p>Weston Public uses a participatory creation strategy and is comprised of a series of short documentaries about the relationship between people and place in multiple sites within Weston-Mount Dennis including; an abandoned Kodak building, a barbershop, a public pool, etc. The short videos are projected through architectural models and exhibited as a site-specific multi-channel video installation.</p> 
<p>Weston Public facilitates a neighbourhood’s participation in its own story and transformation. It makes an interventionist proposition by engaging people in dialogue about where they live, who they are, and how they are represented. It provides a new analytical basis for approaching documentary and design that privileges the dreams, desires, and experiences of a community.</p>

<h4>Slave in a Box: Are Brands Consuming our Culture?</h4> 
<p>Slave in a Box: Are Brands Consuming our Culture? explores the complex relationship between branding, popular culture, and democracy at a time of profound cultural changes brought on by social media. This film explores the fundamental issue of the balance between private desires and public good. The film’s commentary, tracing the rise of branding, as the latest stage of capitalism, is illustrated with advertising and promotional materials for brands such as Pepsi, Nike, and Aunt Jemima. Key arguments from Naomi Klein’s book No Logo, as well as interviews with authors Benjamin Barber, Grant McCracken, and Henry Jenkins feature in the documentary.</p>

<h4>Unfriend</h4> 
<p>There's something happening to language as a result of social media like Facebook. The word “friend” isn’t just a noun anymore. It’s also a verb. You can be friends with someone, and you can friend someone. You can also unfriend someone. This is a totally new term, a verb for the action of breaking off a friendship, and it was the Oxford dictionary’s top addition to the lexicon in 2009. Unfriend is a radio documentary exploring the sometimes painful, shameful, and (let’s face it) often funny world of friendship breakups, be they digital or otherwise. Using interviews, found sound, and narration, Unfriend will resonate with anyone who’s ever had a friend.<br> <a href="http://www.unfriending.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><br> www.unfriending.wordpress.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link, opens in new window</span></a></p>

	<p>Katie Doner relocated to Toronto after graduating with a BA in Intercultural Studies and Art from Houghton College in 2008, where her work was exhibited and awarded prizes.&nbsp; As an emerging documentary artist, her photography is marked by a preoccupation with the human face, an interest sparked by engaging in diverse communities—from urban Buffalo, to Kampala, Uganda, to her own hometown of Beaverton, Ontario.&nbsp; Shaping her photography is a concern with the photographer-subject relationship during the photographic exchange.</p> 
<h4>A Fragile Exchange</h4> 
<p>My photography is rooted in a fascination with the human face.&nbsp; We present ourselves with our faces; we judge others based on their faces.&nbsp; A face can tell a colossal lie or a potent truth.&nbsp; The tenuous power of the visage is both captivating and deceptive. Through a series of portraits accompanied by audio excerpts of the subjects’ reflections on their own faces, A Fragile Exchange uncovers the dynamic nature of the face-to-face encounter and the fragility of first impressions.</p> 
<p>As our societal boundaries for looking remain unclear, we function in two self-opposed extremes: consuming images of the face in commercial culture, meanwhile averting our eyes from strangers’ faces in our daily routines. Creating a meditation on the act of looking, this project encourages an engaged way of seeing as viewers look, listen, learn, and look again. Approaching a life through the face reveals both its self-contained power and the risk inherent in assigning it too much authority.&nbsp; Although a face cannot represent a life, it can be a wonderful place from which to begin an acquaintance.</p> 
<p>A Fragile Exchange allows me to present a series of engaged likenesses, while inviting my subjects to share their perspectives from the other side of the portrait.</p>

<h4>Eternity Rolls</h4> 
<p>Eternity Rolls is a character-driven documentary about the Reverend Dorian Baxter (also known as “Elvis Priestly”) and the faithful congregation of his Elvis-themed Independent Anglican Church, Christ the King, Graceland.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shot in an observational style, Eternity Rolls follows Baxter from his home in Newmarket, Ontario to the gates of Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee.&nbsp; Besides telling the personal story of Baxter’s struggles to realize his own church, Eternity Rolls also examines our cultural obsession with Elvis Presley, the quest for the sacred in everyday life, and how performance and celebrity affect the sanctity and tradition of religion.</p>

<h4>The Canadian: A train ride across Canada (almost) and back again in May 2009</h4> 
<p>The Canadian explores the myth of the railroad through my experience of taking the train (almost) across Canada for the first time. My installation is a meditation on the notion of nostalgia, explored through this romanticized and perceived as old-fashioned method of transport and the landscape it travels through. The work seeks to enable the viewer to relish in the experience of lingering, savouring, and absorbing each stage of the journey, from the initial desire to travel, through to the journey itself.</p> 
<p>Photography and train travel, both invented in the first half of the nineteenth century, enabled a new way of seeing and experiencing the world. Introducing unparalleled speed, the train condensed space by shortening the time it took to cover the distance between two points. The romantic notion of travel by train to “far off” lands was fuelled by the picturesque images that the photographer produced and brought into the home, developing a notion that still exists today.</p> 
<p>Through the ability to see and travel, and explore new terrains, the train and photography led to the growth of tourism, facilitating industrial development and urban expansion.&nbsp; With its role in linking Canada from shore to shore, the train has played a symbolic role in the evolution of Canada’s identity as a nation.</p>

<h4>Seats of Power</h4> 
<p>The ubiquitous chair. Utilitarian object. Object of design. Symbol of power. Chairs are everywhere. We spend many hours a day sitting in chairs, at work and at home. Chair imagery pervades our everyday language and is embedded in a network of symbols. The chair as metaphor appears in such common uses as: Chairman of the Board, to have a seat on the stock exchange, the witness chair, to be on the hot seat. Descartes wrote about the seat of the soul. The title of Chair is bestowed upon high-ranking academics at universities. But why the chair? What is it about chairs? And why should we care?</p> 
<p>Seats of Power is a collection of portraits of the chairs upon which sit political, business, cultural, spiritual, and media icons in Canada—from the grassroots, to municipal, provincial, and national levels of prominence. The work asks the viewer to consider whether these chairs, both individual seats and institutional ones, are worthy of those who use them and how they function as symbols of power, hierarchy, and status. By examining the objects themselves, what if anything, can we learn about the individuals who occupy them, or the expectations, responsibilities, or promise (or lack thereof) a chair can inspire?</p>

<h4>Not Just Boy’s Fun: The Rad Ladies Project</h4> 
<p>Inspired by my female friends and a personal interest in researching subcultures, the online video work Not Just Boy’s Fun: The Rad Ladies Project offers an alternative to traditional documentary form by shifting the director’s role to that of a facilitator and creating a space for expression of self through online media.</p> 
<p>Highlighting my personal experiences and those of other women connected to underground music scenes, Not Just Boy’s Fun: The Rad Ladies Project attempts to bridge the gap between filmmaker and subjects. What began as an idea for a film in response to “rockumentaries” centered around male subjects quickly evolved into a collaborative Web-based project that allows participants to upload their own audiovisual content, building an archive of stories and discussion.</p> 
<p>Through the use of social media and peer-to-peer networks, I am documenting experiences and untold stories, building an online community and offering a fresh take on the relationships between artistic forms, documentary practices, and technology.</p>

	<p>Following his upbringing in Woodstock, Ontario, William Craddock attended Huron University College, at the University of Western Ontario, where he completed a BA in Political Science and Global Studies. As a Toronto-based self-taught photographer and emerging artist Craddock is excited to premier his first film, which incorporates his studies of politics. Craddock’s work utilizes critical, political and social commentary aspiring to engage his viewers with contemporary issues in new ways.</p> 
<h4>Gay Rights: Politics, Activism and Canada's Gay Conservatives</h4> 
<p>The identity of the gay Conservative party supporter is one often seen by many Canadians as hypocritical and contradictory, a seemingly rational judgment given the popular association of the political right with more traditional, often religious, views towards sexuality. For gay Conservatives, though, this is a sweeping misconception: Many consider their right-wing political views as completely and naturally congruent with their sexual identities. For the devoted left, these gays are traitors to the historical ties of Gay Liberation to the political left. Through interviews with a range of gay Conservatives complemented by an examination of archival images and media representations, this film seeks to inform viewers of the complex range of issues surrounding the growing population of gay right-wingers and their roles within the larger contexts of the queer activist movement and contemporary mainstream politics.</p>

<h4>Between Desire</h4> 
<p>Suburbia and sustainability: two loaded words that, when placed in the same sentence, forge an uncomfortable and antagonistic relationship. Visions of waste, environmental appropriation, homogeneity, and sprawl come to mind.</p> 
<p>Between Desire is a photography project examining the space between our needs and desires while situating sustainability at the crossroads of these two paradigms. My photographs point towards the constant outward push of suburban expansion and the inevitable collision of the human-made and natural landscapes. I have asked myself this one question. Does this push exceed the limits of the environment’s natural and self-sustaining entropic flows?</p> 
<p>The project examines a desire to return to Arcadia, albeit an increasingly unattainable dreamscape. The tragedy is, the further we push and disrupt, the very Arcadia we long for moves farther toward the horizon. The photographs point towards two possibilities: one of sustainability and the other, of a desired return to a mythical and pastoral ideal.</p>

<h4>Some Kind of Divine</h4> 
<p>My MRP, Some Kind of Divine, is an exploration of the nature of religious faith. Photographing parishioners in a variety of local churches, I’ve attempted to document the pose of believers through the physical expression of spiritual passion. As a way of addressing issues surrounding exoticism through the display of large-scale black and white prints, I have shot a series of low-resolution video interviews with a wide range of participants expressing views on the nature of God. These views range from atheist to deeply religious, with expressions of doubt and confusion in between. Juxtaposed against traditional photographic presentation, the two media together challenge the language of documentary image making and its implied authenticity.</p>

<h4>Savage Gold</h4> 
<p>The documentary film Savage Gold was inspired by my recent trip to Guatemala where I became aware of a human rights issue that changed the way I perceived Canada. Goldcorp Inc., a Canadian gold mining company operating in Guatemala, has stirred up community conflict, brought agricultural destruction, effected water contamination, and caused illness in the affected communities of San Marcos and Sipacapa.</p> 
<p>A powerful Canadian mining lobby, and the existence of public funding for Goldcorp Inc., makes us all complicit. Scant media attention leaves most Canadians unaware of the ugly legacy being left behind by one of our own companies.</p> 
<p><br> The resistance effort in Guatemala and Canada is receiving more attention in its attempt to hold Goldcorp Inc. accountable to human rights ideals and environmental law. In the film, human rights organizations, Liberal MP John McKay, Guatemalan citizens—including indigenous leaders speak out against the company’s influence in Guatemala and explore the potential for a brighter future.</p>

<h4>Feeding the Brain</h4> 
<p>Mental illness is an increasingly pressing issue for Canadians. Over 1 in 5 Canadians will be diagnosed with a mental health disorder in their lifetime, and millions of dollars will be spent on healthcare and prescription drugs to treat these individuals.

<p>This film tells a story of the struggles that many face in an effort to treat their mental illness, and presents some of the most promising, albeit less conventional solutions that have been found. Mental illness survivors, researchers and healthcare practitioners tell their compelling stories and share the hope of a new paradigm in treating mental illness.&nbsp;<em>Feeding the Brain</em>&nbsp;is a film that addresses the need to re-evaluate the causes of mental illness and the corresponding treatments.</p>

<h4>Behind Closed Doors: Spaces of Accumulation</h4> 
<p>Behind Closed Doors explores the relationship between photography and the archive. By using photography, the medium instrumental in creating the archive, I have effected a visual dialogue about the boundaries and definitions of both documents and archives. By documenting the systems that are central to our creation and perpetuation of collective memory and history, this work examines the authority, power, and fear surrounding these objects and spaces. The images illuminate institutional accumulation and reveal what is often closed to public access.</p>

<h4>21st Century Calling</h4> 
<p>This film examines a controversial rail expansion currently underway in west Toronto. On opposing sides of the issue are the Ontario government, seeking to expand the public transit network, and the local communities, who want to protect their health. Events of the film take place in the Junction Triangle, once a notoriously toxic industrial neighbourhood that will now be re-polluted by the province’s eight-fold increase in diesel train traffic. Citizens have mobilized against a plan they don’t want, and against the politicians they elected to represent them. The government is pushing forward with diesel trains for the expansion, citing financial constraints as the main reason. Local residents want clean electric trains used on the line, arguing that the long-term damage to health negates the short-term savings of going diesel. The community keeps on fighting, but time is running out.</p>

Al-Haidari often uses abstract imagery and surreal performance art to convey universal themes, ranging from the inane and mundane to the magic and mystery of human experience. After graduating from Ryerson University’s Broadcast Journalism program in 2004, Al-Haidari worked as a researcher and associate producer in television current affairs, including VisionTV’s <em>360 Vision</em> and CTV’s <em>SexTV</em>. In addition to her documentary work, Al-Haidari directs and produces music videos for her alter-ego, “Roxi Diabla,” who sings and raps sexy, silly, original music related to gender, sexuality, and relationships. Her debut single and music video “Arabian Dream Queen” was screened at Reelworld Film Festival in April 2010 and can be found on YouTube.</p> <p>Thesis: House of God<em></em></p> <p><em>House of God</em> is a visual, musical, essay-style film that journeys through Toronto’s electronic music scene to examine states of trance facilitated through music, drugs, and dance. Through encounters with musicians, dancers, DJs, academics, and scientists, the film highlights and questions what it means to get lost in the music, and the human search for something more. The experiences of individuals who use song and dance as a way to experience God, including Christian, Native American, Baha’i and Ismaili Muslim, are also paralleled with those who live for the dance floor. A collaborative collage of sound and image, including original music by local and international DJs, as well as video footage, photos, and performance art, <em>House of God</em> aims to propel viewers, eyes wide open, into the realm of the mysterious and mind-altering.</p> </td>

She has been engaged in media creation for over twenty years. After attending the Dawson Institute of Photography (Montreal), she worked as a commercial photographer for many years until the craving for different creative pursuits became irresistible. This desire led to two subsequent degrees in Psychology/Film Studies and Film Production (BA, BFA) at Concordia University in Montreal. Her short fiction films and documentary, <em>Kings </em>(2001), about drag-king culture in Montreal have toured festivals internationally. In 2004, she joined the National Film Board of Canada where she coordinated Doc Shop, a program designed to give emerging filmmakers an opportunity to learn trade skills from industry professionals and to produce a short documentary for broadcast on the CBC. She also contributed to the creation and development of CitizenShift (citizenshift.org), the NFB's first social-media website that she subsequently coordinated for five years. She writes about her varied media endeavours on her blog at wiredtolearn.ca.</p> <p>Thesis: Wired to Learn</p> <p>Is high school education a valuable source of learning? Does it help us reach our full potential as human beings, or to become part of a “;normalized” society? <em>Wired to Learn</em> is a documentary media website, and a site-specific mixed-media installation that addresses these questions and invites the audience to partake in the conversation. While the website invites the audience to follow the production of the installation, it is also a space that is used to share stories about Ayoup's own learning experiences, disseminate audio and video interviews with educators and learners regarding their feelings about education, and aggregate Web sources that offer innovative ideas and opinions about learning and instructing.</p> <p>The mixed-media art installation which takes place in a high school is a means of infusing Ayoup's audio and video media with nostalgia and sensory experiences which a two-dimensional screen cannot reproduce, in order to heighten the memories and conversational urges about one's own educational experiences. Within the installation, learners and educators from seven schools- from the public, private, and alternative sectors within Montreal and Toronto- share their views about how their institution is, or could be, a success or a failure. They also reflect upon their own behaviours as high school participants. The media within the installation are intended to act as mirrors for the subjects and audience within a high school milieu. Ayoup's hope is that they see and hear one another's opinions, observe their own, and bridge a communication gap that typically exists between learners and educators.</p> </td>

Dymond currently resides in Toronto.</p> <p>Thesis: Skin Deep<em></em></p> <p><em>Skin Deep</em> explores issues of empowerment, feminine identity, and self-worth in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. Visual representation of the Downtown Eastside and its residents is often problematic, focusing largely on the shock value of the neighbourhood’s most well-known issues: prostitution, drug addiction, HIV and, perhaps most notoriously, the missing women. While these issues certainly deserve attention, the focus tends to be on individuals-at-risk, rather than the area’s demonstrably strong sense of community, particularly within a feminine context. This multi-screen, non-linear documentary project is a re-creation of “Beauty Night,” a drop-in event which provides beauty services to self-identified, including transgendered, women in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. The project includes short video portraits of the women who attend “Beauty Night,” shown through two-way mirrors, as well as projections of the neighbourhood shot on Super 8 film. The goal of the installation, including the mirrored reflections, is to create a sense of self-reflexivity in the audience, and help to physically close the psychological gap in the social hierarchy.</p> <p><a href="http://jessicadymond.com/">jessicadymond.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link</span></a></p> </td>

Ararat. Following in the path of the late astronaut James Irwin, who led two expeditions in search of the remains of Noah's ark, the narrator inadvertently stumbles across the remains of the often catastrophic history of the surrounding territory, from the iconoclastic period of the Byzantine Empire to the Armenian Genocide of the twentieth century. At the centre of it all lies the highest peak in the region, a mountain imbued with holy status but witness to the violence of countless civilizations.</p> <p>As the opportunities for climbing Mt. Ararat become more precarious, the distant dream of the ark is replaced by the ever-present disaster of the Armenians and the continual denial of the events in modern Turkey. More than a crash course in the history of Christianity in the Near East, <em>The Flood and the Mountain </em>&nbsp;is a philosophical inquiry into the often tenuous relationships between mass destruction, faith, and the image. The film is both an indictment of those who transpose their own order onto God and re-write history for political power, as well as a desperate first-person search for the ineffable - a portrait of an outsider lost in time.</p> </td>

The tools we use are often uncannily effective: For instance, Apple’s iPhoto, which (for the purpose of later helping us sort our photos) silently and without our instruction applies a face detection routine to every photograph added to its library. On our behalf, the software takes on some of the “heavy lifting” involved in understanding an ever-expanding world.<em></em></p> <p><em>Every Face in The Americans</em> is the result of this procedure, as performed on scans of the 1977 edition of Robert Frank’s seminal book <em>The Americans</em>. In capturing faces (or in some cases, what it <em>thinks</em> are faces), iPhoto intervenes in our reading process, assuming some of the responsibilities we traditionally assume ourselves. The result is a set of 58 low-quality, heavily cropped images, selected, framed, and sequenced according to the software’s algorithms. In some cases, we see the actual “Americans,” but reduced, removed from their context. In others, iPhoto’s skill at recognizing a pattern of shapes and contrasts—a syntactic recognition—is subverted by its lack of semantic ability; where it sees a face, we see nothing.</p> <p>Despite their separation from their contexts, the images retain a connection to the photographs from which they are drawn. They invite us to look through them to the original work, focusing on the periphery, considering what has been left out, and reconsidering the processes of selection, framing, sequencing, and seeing.</p> </td>

This small county road, named after the filmmaker’s family for their long history in the area, is a microcosm of agricultural trends that are widespread across Canada.</p> <p>Through conversations with former rural youth from Humphries Road, the film explores their opinions around land development, local organic farming, and the potential of succeeding their family farms.</p> <p>Filmed over four seasons, <em>Humphries Road</em> examines the barriers of farm succession and ultimately the director’s own future in agriculture that manifests itself in the question: If the youth of Canada do not want to succeed their family farms, what are we supposed to eat?</p> </td>

Through the production of several projects John had the opportunity to examine and come to terms with the breakdown she suffered at age 15 and her subsequent diagnosis with severe clinical depression. Themes such as lost memory, stigma, catharsis, destruction, and family relationships are investigated from a feminist perspective. The culmination of these projects is a mixed-media gallery installation.<em></em></p> <p><em>Out of the Darkness</em> makes a strong case for the healing potential of making art. In its open exploration of mental illness, this project allowed John to reclaim a sense of agency and dignity countering the continued social stigma associated with mental illness. The installation also aims to challenge the viewer’s notion of what constitutes a documentary by presenting decidedly avant-garde documentary forms.</p> </td>

Every year approximately 250,000 newcomers arrive in Canada. Between 2001 and 2006, Canada received 1,109,980 new immigrants. Toronto alone welcomed about one quarter of them (267,855) during this period, enhancing the Ontario capital’s status as one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. But what did they think when they first arrived? How difficult was it to start over again? Did they have second thoughts? By interviewing people who came from countries such as Lebanon, Burma, and the Congo this project aims to explore these questions and also to understand the reason behind the subjects’ life-changing decisions.</p> <p>As an immigrant himself, Lima conceived <em>Next-door Neighbour</em> as a personal exploration, to understand more about this country and to find parallels between his experience and that of his subjects. The exhibition presents photographs with accompanying voice recordings conveying the identities of the subjects, their stories, and the emotional aspects of their life in Canada. Both mediums present the viewer with different perspectives about that new life.</p> <p><a href="http://eduardolima.ca/">eduardolima.ca<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link</span></a></p> </td>

Today, more than 2.4 million Canadians have some form of diabetes, and over 240,000 live with type 1.</p> <p>Formerly known as insulin-dependent or childhood-onset diabetes, type 1 diabetes is a lifelong disease that cannot be prevented. Its sufferers are usually diagnosed before the age of 30, most often, like Choi, during childhood or their teen years.</p> <p>With irregular daytime schedules, variable diets, exposure to alcohol, and inconsistent sleeping patterns, teenagers with diabetes must remember that neglecting to successfully manage their self-administered treatment can cause serious complications and even death. This is the extreme side of the illness. Through hard work and vigilance, patients can maintain control of their blood sugar and experience long periods of good health.</p> <p>Through a combination of text and imagery, the book <em>Type 1 Teen</em> follows Choi over the period of one year as she contemplates the next stage in her young life: university, and a transition from adolescent to adult diabetes care.</p> <p><a href="http://christophermanson.com/">christophermanson.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link</span></a></p> </td>

All three grew up in rural Saskatchewan and each succeeded in creating a unique path in a place and at a time of limited options. For each woman the surrounding landscape is intrinsic to her existence. Bernadette Greuel writes and recites poetry inspired by her role as a mother and farmer’s wife. Susanna Bauer makes art from whatever she finds around her—whether it is pine cones, seeds, bark, feathers, or road kill. Sister Maureen Maier worked tirelessly to save the environment that she felt saved her, the convent where she became a nun at age 18, and continues to help preserve the history of her prairie sisterhood. These three women are strongly defined by rural life. What gives them their voice also nearly renders them invisible in its vastness; they are restricted by it while simultaneously inspired by it. Rather than allow themselves to be devoured by isolation and tradition, they’ve used resourcefulness and determination to surpass expectation. Until now their audience has been small.

Conversion to Judaism is neither easy nor straightforward. It requires one-to-three years of study.

Through a series of conversations and interviews, <em>In God’s Keeping</em> looks at different aspects of Moore’s life as she reviews where her quest for a relationship with God began, how she veered off course, and why she is hesitant about becoming Jewish despite being drawn to Judaism. <em>In God’s Keeping</em> documents one woman’s journey towards Judaism, but it adds a voice to the growing number of autobiographical films and books about conversion. Traditionally not talked about, converts to Judaism now often refer to themselves as “Jews-by-choice” and are eager to share their stories and experiences of love for tradition and ritual and acceptance in a community that, throughout history, has turned prospective converts away three times in order to ensure their sincerity.</p> </td>

It is about revisiting sites of memory In Toronto containing little or no visible traces of their public and private significance.

The sites and stories range from early aviation history and Hurricane Hazel to the marginalized history of women’s efforts in World War II and the neglected cemetery site of an early Toronto psychiatric hospital. By photographing these sites and re-presenting them with their hidden histories, this project intends to provoke dialogue about the intangible place of memories and their relationship to photographs and documentary studies. Using the postcard as a vehicle furthers this project’s intent to be distributed and absorbed into the personal archives of the audience. The souvenir postcards reproduced from the photographs are intended to activate the possessor’s faculty of memory along with personal and collective narratives at a later point in the ritual of remembering and story-telling. <em>Toronto Souvenir</em> encourages a deeper exploration of place, beyond the visible landscape into the living memories of people and their landscapes of memory.</p> <p><a href="http://garett-walker.com/">garett-walker.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link</span></a></p> </td>

As the main contributor to the Utilan economy, tourism is important to the livelihood of the local population. Many efforts are being made by the Honduran government to promote Utila and the Bay Islands as top tourist destinations through the use of images representing idealized notions of beauty, without much regard for the potential negative social and environmental after-effects of the industry.</p> <p>Less than 500m from Main Street lies <em>barrio</em> Camponado—the poorest part of Utila—an area that has been sold to Hispanic migrants from the mainland as low-income property. This is where large quantities of drugs are sold, literacy rates are the lowest, and a considerable amount of crime occurs. Yet nowhere in the plentiful tourist guidebooks or colourful Utilan postcards is Camponado mentioned or commemorated. Similarly, problems such as over-fishing, drinking water shortages, racially-motivated caste systems, mangrove and coral reef devastation, and the illegal killing of endangered animals (including the Swamper iguana and several shark species) are also kept from such literature, despite the role of tourism in exacerbating them.</p> <p>Zonjic’s project urges the audience to recognize the ways in which framing dictates our perceptions and negates different types of realities excluded in the process.</p> <p>https://vimeo.com/58316237</p> </td>

The lack of communication and segregation between Roma and non-Roma in the Czech Republic and Slovakia enable discrimination and prejudice to flourish. <em>Romano Drom: A Story of Youth </em>is a personal attempt at bridging this divide and creating a space where respectful dialogue about the issues that affect these Roma youth can begin.</p> <p>At a time when media largely portray Roma youth as criminal and uneducated, the film's subjects challenge the negative and simplistic stereotypes imposed on them by actively seeking positive change in their communities.</p> </td>

Addressing historical and contemporary issues within the discourses of landscape, philosophy, and urban development, The Nature of Urbanity employs aerial photo-panoramic composites of urban vegetable gardens, exposing this relationship by juxtaposing the mathematical precision and control of constructed space with the organic chaos of foliage and greenery.</p> <p>The garden as a physical and intellectual space is essential to understanding the evolution of the nature concept in culture. The garden represents humanity's first organization into society bringing freedom from the tumults of life in the wilderness and allowing for the construction of our most romantic and idyllic notions of nature. Given the current global entropic crisis, we need to reconsider our integration in the global biosphere, which will require an empathic re-envisioning of our physical and metaphysical relationship with nature.</p> <p>Our understanding of nature emerges directly from a changing idea of what it means to be human. This ultimately determines how we think about and act toward the world. On the one hand, we have developed nature as a realm of physical "stuff" studied and defined by science, while on the other, we approach it through a transcendental reverence that invokes the sublime. What is routinely missed, ignored, feared, or disclaimed in an effort to maintain the intellectual purity of the binary is nature‚Äôs existence as a product of culture.</p> </td>

Jibbe still remembers how the women huddled together, children by their side, peeling potatoes and often chatting about their daily concerns and private affairs.

Couples that experience difficulties conceiving are often stigmatized. Women are held responsible regardless of who the infertile spouse is. <em>Waiting for Waladi</em> is a film that tells the stories of three Bedouin women from the Lebanese Bekaa Valley who had to deal with their husbands’ infertility. The documentary aims to expose the cultural burdens of marriage on young women and the subsequent pressures by family members on newlywed couples to bear children. Not being able to bear children, the three women share a familiar story that is repeated throughout many parts of the world: They are immediately blamed for the infertility and are forced to live in shame. <em>Waiting for Waladi</em> is an intimate portrait that lets viewers hear the voices of women discussing a matter that is almost undiscussable in the Middle East.</p> <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p> </td>

In Kelabit culture, the <em>tetel</em> was a place for mediation, negotiation, matchmaking and communal gatherings. Today, Kelabit language and culture are gradually disappearing as young Kelabits leave for urban centres to further their education. With this project Marcus Raja, herself a curious and eager member of the Kelabit tribe, aims to highlight the declining relevance of the <em>tetel</em> to the Kelabit community and to explore some of the causes and effects of the loss of its traditional function. For Marcus Raja, the <em>tetel</em> has acted as a bridge to transfer knowledge about family structure, traditional culture, and social relationships. Its loss represents the loss of Kelabit language and culture in the race for progress, it represents changing realities.</p> <p>Her installation examines Kelabit concepts of individual, communal, and cultural identity as Kelabit voices, around the <em>tetel</em>, tell stories of continuity and change across the last few decades. As the Kelabit embrace development, the rapid disappearance of the <em>tetel</em> has affected Kelabit oral history and language, changing the social context and experience of communal gatherings. By reconstructing and humanizing the <em>tetel</em> in this installation, Marcus Raja explores the topic of cultural deterioration.

The project consists of large-scale colour photographs, and a double-projection video. Some of the photographs are studio portraits where Sumaya sat for the artist; others depict Sumaya in her daily life. One video also documents aspects of her daily life, while the other portrays Sumaya performing a Somali ritual usually reserved for women. This practice is one that Somali women undertake when preparing for a special occasion or ceremony. The practice itself is a hybrid: traditional and religious. The double projection is meant to add texture and complexity to Osman’s attempt to engage with questions of gender, sexuality, and culture. The videos speak to the hybrid cultural expressions of Sumaya and other persons like her. These images place African-born trans-people directly within the traditions of their African/black cultural heritage. While posing questions concerning gender, culture, and religion, the videos examine how the body can move into new states of being. They are themselves “trans-ing” practices, crossing the traditional with the new all-in-one body. This work pushes back against claims made by some African leaders that there are no African queers in their countries. Osman’s work puts African/black trans-people on record. It questions how we understand the various roles bodies play or perform, and which bodies or genders are understood to perform them—in particular, assumptions we make about female, black, queer, and trans bodies.</p> </td>

Mohammadi is recognized in his native country as the president of the Afghan International Peace Federation. This makes him a target for the Taliban and other criminal organizations who believe in war-mongering policies and practices. Mohammadi has been a prisoner of war in Afghanistan. He has lost much of his immediate family through violent criminal acts and has been critically wounded three separate times in his journey to discover a life without the threat of violence. In 2010 Abdul was forced to escape from his native country and leave behind his family—who now wait for his unlikely remittance under the strict surveillance of the government. Through the fragmented representation of Canada’s urban peripheries as unfamiliar territory, <em>Memories of Panjshir</em> blends Mohammadi’s tangible surroundings with the invisible force of the recollections he is unable to control. By encouraging dialogue around flashbulb memories triggered by the ordinary, this project highlights the problem of post-traumatic stress disorder in victims of war and torture as they struggle to adapt to refugee life in Canada.</p> </td>

Arianne Persaud decided to buy a side of grass-fed beef with some friends in Toronto as a way of connecting with the food she ate. It was also a means of coping with paranoia about the state of factory farms and “conventional” meat. This simple act started the wheels turning as Persaud soon realized that this “grass-fed beef” which she had gone out of her way to obtain was something that was readily available in her home country — Guyana. The film continues with the paradox as Persaud meets with like-minded young people who are all similarly going out of their way to be involved in the production of their food. But the memory of home is ever-present and the effortless way that the closeness to food is maintained there is contrasted against the strivings of young Torontonians to find healthy food. In <em>The Grass Is Always Greener </em>two societies are joined together in a manner that highlights the shared history of human food production and consumption, and the psychology that separates those societies.</p> </td>

Roback is driven by documentary’s ability to record and share the stories of those who are marginalized, in order to effect and inspire change.</p> <p>&nbsp;Thesis: Brunswick St</p> <p><em>Brunswick St. </em>tells the story of a group of young friends in Halifax in the 1970s. Amidst the ethos resulting from the civil rights movement, the feminist movement, and the opposition to the Vietnam War spilling over into Canada, the group found a commonality in each other — to “create a better world.” With the idea that one’s actions on a personal level can have a larger political impact, the group set out to work and live cooperatively, building a community based on shared ideals around equality and social justice in an effort to create this different, better world. Interweaving past and present-day footage, the filmmaker threads a story about her parents and their friends in their quest to live differently. <em>Brunswick St.</em> explores themes of youth engagement and community in working towards social change — a story that remains timeless.</p> </td>

Laarossi blends traditional songs with African desert blues music on electric guitars. His band, Imodda, uses music to preserve their cultural heritage, to inspire Amazigh youth to take pride in their language and culture, and to fight for Amazigh rights in North Africa.</p> <p>Spending the first years of his life in the backcountry of the Sahara Desert, Laarossi is profoundly influenced by the desert landscape, in both his life and work. He writes lyrics rich in metaphors about the natural world and uses them as a way to speak out against state policies aimed at erasing the identity and memory of his people. The story interweaves scenes of his band, lots of music, and discussions from community members, artists, and activists to reveal a flourishing Amazigh revival in Morocco led by artists and youths.</p> </td>

Originally from Prince Edward Island, Skinner studied fine art at Mount Allison University in 1983, followed by a year at the Alberta College of Art, before completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) University in 1989. During her studies, she developed an interest in ferry systems and their cultural significance. In 1992, Skinner received a grant from the Prince Edward Island Council of the Arts to document the final years of the Borden/Cape Tormentine Ferry before the opening of the Confederation Bridge linking P.E.I. to New Brunswick. Since then she has documented ferries throughout the Maritimes, the UK, and Toronto. Her work has been exhibited at the Anna Leonowens Gallery in Halifax, and Harbourfront Gallery and AWOL Gallery in Toronto.</p> <p>Thesis: Passages</p> <p><em>Passages</em> is a photographic documentary which explores the 179-year history of the Toronto Island Ferry and its interrelationship with the residents and non-residents of the Toronto Islands. The fifteen-minute ferry ride transports passengers from a busy and chaotic downtown core to an idyllic and peaceful landscape, creating an interesting psychological and physical shift. One aspect of this journey is a linear sequence of events in time (a beginning, middle, and end), while the other is non-linear involving inner thought and memory. In this vein, <em>Passages </em>explores how the external journey maps the internal world.</p> <p>A ferry not only transports people between geographical and psychological realities but also changes over time with advances in technology and modes of transportation (that is, the introduction of faster ferries and the building of bridges). Ferries can become historical relics offering a unique focus for exploring the evolving and dissolving connections between subject and place. Combining contemporary photographs with archival imagery, <em>Passages </em>examines time, place, and the archive’s role in documentary practice.</p> <p><a href="http://www.marilynruthskinner.ca/">www.marilynruthskinner.ca<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link</span></a><strong></strong></p> </td>

The audience first navigates a physical manifestation of a thoroughly researched paper exploring the nature of documentary forms across varied artistic disciplines. The research paper is reduced to a series of five statements describing each fundamental characteristic of documentary. Audience members experience each of the five characteristics sequentially as they pass through a series of doors—each door not only communicating a single characteristic but also alluding to the scholarship and theory in which the particular argument is grounded. Beyond the series of doors lies a collection of documentary art pieces which all exhibit the five fundamental characteristics of documentary. This collection of art exclaims that, "Yes, this is all documentary work," yet allows each work to speak for itself and makes no value judgments on any work. In addition to the thematic connection of "exhibiting documentary characteristics," both the series of doors and the various documentary art pieces explore notions of passages through space and time.</p> </td>

On a political level, the creation of fictitious cityscapes highlights the interconnections between contexts and engages the viewer in a non-didactic deciphering of what lies in the interstices of here and there. By creating representations that highlight hybridity and translocality, the use of fictitious landscapes subverts the neocolonial gaze that imposes and demands cultural authenticity. Cities are presented as alive, inhabited, and bearing signs of resistance without being reproduced in images as exotic “others” and bucolic landscapes “untouched” by civilization—some of the familiar visual tropes of colonial and neocolonial photography.</p> <p>On a personal level, the creation of fictitious cityscapes reflects the artist’s experience of the contexts that she inhabits in Canada and Lebanon as being materially but not sensually distinct. It is a frequent occurrence that a smell, sight, or feeling she experiences in Toronto reminds her of Beirut. For many immigrants and others displaced by war, poverty, or other reasons, memories of place not only exist at an intellectual level, but also as an embodied sensation of being transposed to another place. The creation of fictitious cityscapes that bring together the here and there resonates on a level of understanding that goes beyond descriptions of place and time to a level of feeling, thinking, and experiencing, that encapsulates what it feels like to exist in more than one place at once.</p> <p><a href="http://samanthawehbi.pixpasites.com/">http://samanthawehbi.pixpasites.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link</span></a></p> </td>

The film features two protagonists, Marta, a hardened twenty-year-old from Estonia and Holly a wide-eyed thirteen-year-old from Ottawa.

This experience inspired Beaver’s interest in the creative and social impact of documentary filmmaking. In <em>On Reserve</em>, Beaver explores themes of First Nations identity and the repercussions of the Indian Act.Thesis: On Reserve</p> <p>The relationship between First Nations people and broader Canadian society is hindered by a&nbsp; perpetual lack of understanding. Starting from this premise, <em>On Reserve </em>is a film imbued with&nbsp; belief in the transformative powers of storytelling. Influenced by the style of Allen King’s&nbsp; actuality dramas, <em>On Reserve</em> invites the viewer into an experience of reserve life. The film, set&nbsp; in Alderville First Nation, Ontario, home of Canada’s first industrial school (precursor of the&nbsp; residential school), explores the consequences of Canada’s aggressive assimilation policy. By&nbsp; following elder Carl Beaver, the film takes viewers through the life rhythms of the community,&nbsp; showing various characters along the way. Though directly affected by First Nations politics,&nbsp; it is curious how little Carl (like many others) knows about the history of aboriginal people in&nbsp; Canada. This begins to change as Carl’s curiosity is provoked by talk of the growing Idle No&nbsp; More movement. Carl begins to see that while Idle No More began as a First Nations effort, the&nbsp; issues at stake affect all Canadians. Our democracy and our environment are on the line. If there&nbsp; was ever a time for people to set aside their differences and unite, this is it.</p> </td>

The project addresses the personal experience of criminal justice by focusing on the individuals who defend the accused.</p> <p>After more than a year of conducting interviews with his subjects, Epstein assembled a database of recorded video and still portraiture that depict lawyers in their work spaces.

The subject matter of the installation is the everyday, overlooked fences that exist everywhere in the city of Toronto. What began as an exploration into artist Sarah Gladki’s obsession with looking at fences has evolved into a project that considers how seeing and studying elements of the overlooked can reveal new insights about the city and the self. To communicate this, the installation <em>Navigating, Fences</em> expresses Gladki’s experience as she travelled through the streets of Toronto in search of fences to photograph, while it also shows how Gladki sees fences: Each possesses its own unique character.</p> <p>Gladki’s focus on fences explores the emotive aspects of architectural structures and their innate connection to their geographical locations. This way of seeing introduces a new or unrealized experience of the city, bringing attention to a structure that is often overlooked, and commonly perceived of as an obstruction—limiting and barring. The interplay between architecture and individual perception is at work here, where both act to shape and influence the other. &nbsp;</p> </td>

Conventional wisdom holds that sex, as designated at birth, determines gender but in fact gender is a construct.

Transgender individuals from a range of ages, backgrounds, and circumstances share their observations of, and lived experience in, our gendered world. Inspired by Levinas’ claim that “the face presents itself and demands justice,” these individuals turn to face the audience only when a viewer is close to the screen.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Tacheles played an iconic role in the artistic life of the German capital. Located on Oranienburger Strasse in Mitte, the history of the art house reflected the changing social climate in Berlin.

Kathak was primarily&nbsp; performed by male dancers, who told the stories based on Hindu mythology in temple settings. Now it has&nbsp; been shaped by modern influences and gone through many iterations to come to the theatre stage.<em></em></p> <p><em>Kathak in Motion</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; traces the dance’s journey using the life experiences of Sandhya Desai (72), exploring&nbsp; past and present dance practices, and how traditions evolve from one generation to another. Sandhya&nbsp; began dancing at age 24, after her marriage to Atul Desai—an Indian classical musician who played a significant role in her success as an established Kathak dancer, teacher, and choreographer. Atul was a&nbsp; music pioneer who introduced novel musical compositions that changed the focus of the Kathak repertoire&nbsp; from traditional temple stories to tales of contemporary life. He has worked closely with one of India’s&nbsp; renowned Kathak dancers and choreographers, Kumudini Lakhia. Set in Atul and Sandhya’s adopted&nbsp; hometown of Toronto, the film explores the journey of Kathak dance through conversations with Sandhya,&nbsp; her dedicated dance disciples, and their performances.</p> </td>

The film documents their attempts to seek deeper spiritual meaning in their lives. As the director sets out on her own journey to discover what’s missing in our world and to understand the seekers, she delves into the connection between two of the world’s oldest wisdom traditions, Buddhism and Native American spirituality, leading us on a larger journey of interconnected consciousness. The film explores whether the answer to shifting our worldview is found in science or spirituality, or both. Filmed in Arkansas, Colorado, Ontario, and elsewhere, <em>SEEKERS</em> is centred on two events: an 800-person gathering at the base of a mountain sacred to Native Americans in Hot Springs, Arkansas, to raise worldwide spiritual consciousness, and a gathering of 800 at the Wake Up Festival, an inaugural assembly of seekers and spiritual teachers in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. <em>SEEKERS </em>documents a growing counter-tradition, a weave of voices and ideas that have nothing to do with today’s mainstream consumer society.</p> </td>

This professional&nbsp; experience soon became a personal journey about hope, a promise, and a re-encounter. <em>Healers </em>tells the story of a woman known as Dona Josefa who has been&nbsp; a health care worker, midwife, and community leader for over 50 years. Besides&nbsp; taking care of villagers, she can deeply affect people who cross her path, like&nbsp; filmmaker Gabi Veras—who had a dream of becoming a mother. After a promise&nbsp; made by Veras, the director returns to Sertão—Brazil’s most neglected area—and&nbsp; discovers the world of herbal medicine.&nbsp; <em>Healers</em> shows that despite the lack of support from authorities in these remote&nbsp; areas, traditional medicines which combine prayer with the use of herbs are slowly&nbsp; making governments realize their power.

Often the sheer volume of visual branding material in our daily environment is overwhelming, obscuring the city it is built on, producing new architectural forms and spaces. We need new ways of seeing and analyzing these spaces. By highlighting the presence of visual branding, this project seeks to engage the viewer in a discourse with these new architectural forms, and present new critical ways of understanding them.

These two names neatly bracket the combination of struggle and promise present in this rural location and its starkly beautiful, economically challenging terrain.</p> <p>Informed by the “city symphony” documentary film tradition, with its lyrical observation of people in urban environments, <em>Hardscrabble </em>is presented as a “country symphony” comprised of three movements. The first—“The Road In”—explores Woroner’s personal attachment to this place, which stretches back more than two decades. The second movement—“Survival”—branches out to explore the marks made on this locale in the short time that non-aboriginal people have inhabited the area, with emphasis on the centrality of family and the fluctuating clash between nature and humans. The final part—“The Road Out”—posits Golden Valley as a microcosm of the widespread disappearance of sustainable small-scale rural communities in Ontario.</p> <p>Straddling a divide between subjective concerns and empathetic engagement, this series of photographs blends personal reflection with social commentary. While disparate elements arc from introspection to wider perspectives, veiled references to intergenerational trauma imbue the work with a somber subtext.

As part of the UAE’s expatriate population, Zaidi’s family is one of many that has no access to government healthcare and no option for permanent residency. Contrasting the opulence of Dubai with its absence of social benefits, <em>Safar </em>examines the lack of security felt by the UAE’s expatriate population.

Ultimately, her desire is that by exploring the politics surrounding <em>Shift, </em>this documentary will force audiences to question their own understanding of art<em> </em>and the role of art in public spaces.&nbsp;</p> <p>Short explorative film about <em>Shift:</em></p> <p><a href="http://youtu.be/NHpl0Yyr9tY">http://youtu.be/NHpl0Yyr9tY<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link</span></a><u></u></p> </td>

Her area of interest is the relationship between the photographic image and its referent. The experience that has had the most influence on her photographic perception is neither her exhibitions nor her publications, but rather the insight she gained while teaching and working with visually impaired/blind youth where she used photography as a means of communication and therapy. For her second major in Fine Arts, she attended Ryerson to work on a documentary film about the condition of blind youth in Iran.</span><em></em></p> <p><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span></p> <span><em>Light of My Eyes</em>&nbsp;creates a portrait of Zahra, an 11-year-old Iranian girl who was born blind. The film focuses on how Zahra’s identity is shaped through the social and corporeal challenges she faces daily. Despite being talented and outgoing, Zahra does not have a lot of friends. Instead, she spends most of her time playing with her dolls and listening to TV series, which imbues her with a vivid imagination and strong performance abilities.</span><p>&nbsp;</p> </td>

She is a former resident of Niagara Falls, a city that unites the powers of natural wonder and artificial awe. Her work explores the gap between the surreal and the real, a testament to the spectacle and beauty of this city she calls home. Julie is an installation and performance artist working within a variety of disciplines (photo, video, sound) to create sensory experiences and environments for the viewer.</p> <p>Thesis:</p> <p>The work explores the mystique and the material of the Sonoran Desert; surreal, otherworldly elements juxtaposed with the very real and relentless nature of the landscape.&nbsp;All of the world's biomes occur in the Sonoran Desert region. It is for this very reason that the vast and open space radiates a special collective energy. Through performance and installation, the work will address what it means to be human in such an environment. The purpose of the work is to build a bridge between the gallery space and the desert, to bring the sweep of the desert back to human scale, to connect people with their mortality, with the land, with the energy, to bring the sky down to earth.</p> <p><u><a href="http://www.juliegemuend.com" target="_blank">www.juliegemuend.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link, opens in new window</span></a></u></p> </td>

The holograms are made of an ammonium dichromate gelatin emulsion on glass. The subject of the works are light reflected off of compositional glass structures to emphasize that we only ever see light not its physical forms. The holograms can be described as abstract, but they also contain an indexical relationship between the reflected light off the objects which is molecularly coded inside the emulsion. The holograms are an analogue recording of light in space during a moment in time, but because of the process, the works are more interpretational than an exact recording of reality. If anything we ever encounter visually is either reflected light or its absence, than with these holograms we can meditate on just the light, the object without physical form. This provides us an opportunity to think differently about the link between recording and representation and it allows us to consider all objects that are visually perceived as light in space.</p> <p><a href="http://www.natagraphy.com" target="_blank">www.natagraphy.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-external-link"></span><span class="sr-only">, external link, opens in new window</span></a></p> </td>

Twenty-six years after the worst sporting disaster in British history, the fight for justice and peace finally has an arena. With new inquests into the deaths opened in April 2014, Our Steve looks at the process of having twenty-six-year-old questions answered and the effects the inquests have had on the artist and her family members.</span></p> </td>
