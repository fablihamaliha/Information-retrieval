<p>It is essential that the required subject prerequisite(s) and grade(s) for specific Ryerson programs form part of the academic background of applicants from outside of Ontario, especially in the last two years of high school studies.</p>
<p>Please note that subject prerequisites vary by program. For individual program subject prerequisite requirements, visit the <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/canadian/">Canadian Secondary School Applicants</a></span> webpage.<br>
</p>
<p>Unless noted otherwise, subject prerequisite grades required for admission (normally in the 65-75 percent range) are determined on the basis of competition.</p>
<p>While minimum averages/grades are stated, applicants may be required to present averages/grades above the minimum. Ryerson receives more applications than spaces available. The averages/grades required for admission selection to each program is determined on the basis of competition each year. Possession of minimum averages and/or grades does not guarantee admission.</p>
<p>Applicants to all engineering programs, the Accounting &amp; Finance program, and select programs in the Faculty of Science, should note that calculus is required.</p>

Applicants should ensure they are selecting the correct program code(s) for their desired program choice(s); the codes are available in each online application.&nbsp; Applicants interested in part-time programs should ensure that they select the part-time option on the application form.&nbsp; Part-time programs are listed separately, after the full-time programs.</p>
<p>Program offerings for both the winter and spring/summer terms are limited.&nbsp; Program availability can be verified on the <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/apply/program-status/">Program Accepting Applications</a></span> page.</p>
<p>Note: All applicants to Grades-Plus programs in the Faculty of Communication and Design, and the Architectural Science program, are required to pay a Non-Academic Requirements Fee of $50 per program.&nbsp; The fee is paid at the time of submission of the non-academic requirements.&nbsp; Please visit the applicable <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/programs/undergraduate/">program</a></span> page for details.</p>
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Communications</span></p>
<p><strong>Ryerson’s primary mode of communication is the Choose&gt;Ryerson Applicant Portal and email.</strong></p>
<p>All applicants are required to use a Choose&gt;Ryerson Applicant Portal (<span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="http://choose.ryerson.ca">choose.ryerson.ca</a></span>), and will be sent personal login details to their email account after their application for admission has been received.<br>
<br>
Application status and applicant communications are viewable in the Choose&gt;Ryerson Applicant Portal. Applicants must regularly monitor their Choose&gt;Ryerson Applicant Portal, and read all of the information that is posted to the 'My Application Status' and 'My Communications' sections.&nbsp;Applicants are strongly advised to print and save all communications posted to their 'My Communications' section.</p>
<p>If an applicant’s email address changes, Ryerson must be updated immediately, through appropriate channels. Applicants should ensure that they have edited/updated their 'spam' filters to prevent important and time-sensitive email communications from being filtered out as spam.</p>
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Application Changes/Updates</span></p>
<p>Applicants may review and change their completed OUAC 101 or 105 application once it has been submitted. If any revisions to the application are made, Ryerson will be notified of the changes shortly after the submission to the OUAC. Although all changes are important to the processing of each application, changes to program choice, surname, mailing, email and home addresses are of significant importance and should be made via the OUAC application as soon as the situation arises.</p>
<p>Applicants who have applied via the Ryerson Application must notify Undergraduate Admissions of any changes in application, address, email, telephone numbers and/or other information as soon as they arise using the Ryerson Change Form, available on the <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/applications-related-forms/">Applications and Related Forms</a></span> page.</p>
<p>For applicants that have applied to Ryerson in a previous academic year: if the name on the application has changed in any way, proof of this name change (i.e. marriage certificate, notarized statement or other legal document) must be provided.&nbsp; Applicants must submit their legal name on the application; short forms or nicknames should not be used.&nbsp; Applicants using the OUAC applications will be given the option to include their preferred name(s) in a separate field.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Changes (e.g. to application/amendments/condition extensions, etc.) may not be made verbally, either in person or by telephone. Most communication from Ryerson is date sensitive. Applicants who fail to respond within stated time frames may have their application or Offer of Admission cancelled.<br>

Additional information regarding documents and academic transcripts can be found on the <span class="main_content_new_window"><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/apply/document-submission/">Submission of Documents</a></span> page.</p>
<p>All documents are routinely verified.

<strong></strong>Ryerson requires applicants to upload their documents, where applicable, via Choose&gt;Ryerson Applicant Portal. In extenuating circumstances, if applicants are unable to upload documents, they should be submitted by mail/courier to Ryerson University, Undergraduate Admissions, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON Canada M5B 2K3.</p>
<p>All academic transcripts received via the Choose&gt;Ryerson Applicant Portal are considered <strong>unofficial</strong>. If offered admission, official academic transcripts must be provided as detailed in the Offer letter and sent using the OUAC Transcript Request Form, or by mail in a sealed envelope directly from the issuing institution. <strong>Maintaining an Offer of Admission will be dependent on the receipt and verification of official documents, and meeting/fulfilling all other conditions stated in the Offer letter.&nbsp;</strong> To ensure documents are received by applicable deadlines, it is essential that applicants make all the necessary arrangements for the submission of required official academic transcripts well in advance of the deadline date stated in the Offer of Admission.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Ontario University, College and Secondary School Transcripts</span></p>
<p>Applicants who are attending or have previously attended an Ontario university or college can request academic transcripts via the Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) Transcript Request Form (TRF). Some exceptions may apply. See the OUAC Application Guide for details.<br>
</p>
<p>Certain secondary schools in Ontario allow applicants to request official secondary school transcripts electronically (completed courses only) using an online service hosted by the Ontario College Application Service (OCAS). The OUAC has partnered with OCAS to offer this service to university applicants and it can be accessed from the&nbsp;105 application&nbsp;in the “Transcripts” section under “Ontario High Schools” and “Find out if you’re eligible”. If the secondary school is not included in this online service, the secondary school or applicable school board, must be contacted by the applicant to arrange for the submission of the official academic transcript. Ryerson University reserves the right to require official documents at any time during the application/admission process, and to rescind any Offer of Admission if discrepancies are found between unofficial and official documents.</p>
<p><span class="fontSizeMedium">Important Notes</span></p>
<p>All application information and documentation provided in support of an application must be true, accurate, complete, and have been prepared entirely by the applicant. No relevant information, academic or otherwise, can be withheld. Applicants may be required to provide documentation to the University to substantiate an application and the University has the authority to verify any information provided. Any misrepresentation of information may cause an application/Offer of Admission/enrolment to be cancelled by the University at any time (see Ryerson's Academic Code of Conduct). It is each applicant's responsibility to read the information posted in the <a href="/admissions/undergraduate/after-applying/">After Applying</a> section of the Ryerson website, and understand the policies and procedures as noted.<br>

See <a href="/admissions/undergraduate/apply/document-submission/">Submission of Documents</a>.</p>
<p>Applicants from a country where English is not the first language, or where English is an official language but not the first language, are required to provide proof of English proficiency at a satisfactory level.

Transfer applications (including supporting documents, where required) will be given equal consideration provided they are received by the guaranteed consideration date. Requests received after these dates will be considered subject to space availability. There is no guarantee that a student will be able to transfer to another program. Students requesting a transfer will compete with all other candidates for admission, and consideration is subject to space.</p>
<p>Students are advised that they can have formal status in only one Ryerson degree program (including special student studies) at any given time. When a student confirms acceptance of an offer to transfer from one Ryerson program to another, and is matriculated to the new program, the student forfeits their status in the original program. Students who decide to continue in their current program must log into my.ryerson.ca and access the Admissions tab in RAMSS to decline the Offer of Admission.</p>
<p>Students who have a Required to Withdraw (RTW) standing, may not transfer to ANY Ryerson program until 12 months have elapsed following the RTW Standing (regardless of program). As well, no courses taken at Ryerson (or elsewhere) within this 12 month period will be granted Ryerson credit, except courses completed as part of the Student Success Program (Fresh Start).</p>
<p>Students cannot apply to transfer to ANY Ryerson program immediately after receiving Permanent Program Withdrawal standing. Students may only apply to a different program for the fall semester of the following calendar year (regardless of program).<br>
