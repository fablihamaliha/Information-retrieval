    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>This document describes the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Management System to be implemented at Ryerson University.&nbsp; An Environmental Health and Safety System is comprehensive; covering all functions, positions and activities, and is workplace-specific.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It consists of:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an EHS Policy statement that provides the overarching norm that the EHS System is designed to promote;</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a set of prescriptive principles that further develop the meaning and intent of the EHS Policy statement;</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organizational statements that outline the distribution of authority, responsibility and accountability for EHS throughout the organization; and</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an interlocking set of EHS programs, where each program is associated with a set of EHS concerns and details the responsibilities, procedures, standards and so forth that address those EHS concerns.</p> 
<p>The EHS management system is incorporated within the University’s EHS risk management strategy and is designed to facilitate due diligence under the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act and Ryerson’s commitment to a duty of care for the learning environment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The system establishes the means by which each member of the Ryerson community can achieve their personal legal responsibilities within the statutory duties of the internal responsibility system and obligations inherent in their relationship with Ryerson.</p> 
<h2>Definitions</h2> 
<p><strong>Civility:&nbsp;</strong>Civility involves treating others with dignity and respect, and acting with regard to other's feelings.</p> 
<p>Disrespect must not be confused with legitimate comment and/or advice from managers and supervisors on the work performance or work-related behaviour of an individual or group. Feedback on work performance or work-related behaviour differs from incivility or harassment in that feedback is intended to assist employees to improve work performance or the standard of their behaviour.</p> 
<p>Civility requires that even the most critical feedback be delivered respectfully, privately, and courteously.</p> 
<p><strong>Due Diligence:</strong>&nbsp;taking all steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to avoid harm.</p> 
<p><strong>Harassment:</strong>&nbsp;a course of unwanted remarks, behaviours, or communications in any form, where the person responsible for the remarks, behaviours or communications knows or ought reasonably to know that these are unwelcome.</p> 
<p><strong>Hazard:</strong>&nbsp;a dangerous object, event, behaviour or condition which can interrupt or interfere with the expected orderly progress of an activity. The Ontario OHS Act recognizes that persons’ behaviors can constitute a workplace hazard where such behaviors are likely to expose a worker to physical injury.</p> 
<p><strong>Internal Responsibility System:</strong>&nbsp;the philosophical approach to health and safety, which underlies the Ontario OHS Act, whereby responsibility for health and safety is shared by all parties in the workplace.</p> 
<p><strong>Officer:</strong>&nbsp;the following persons are officers of Ryerson:&nbsp; The President, Provost and Vice Presidents and the Secretary to the Board.</p> 
<p><strong>Program:</strong>&nbsp;an integrated set of responsibilities, measures and procedures, standards and major activities required to accomplish objectives and fulfill principles under a system.</p> 
<p><strong>Remuneration:&nbsp;</strong>financial compensation or acknowledgement of any form including bursaries, stipends or salary for work or activity performed on behalf of the University.</p> 
<p><strong>Safe:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;a condition where risks are as low as reasonably practicable, with no significant residual risk.</p> 
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong>&nbsp;a person who has charge of an area or activity involving a worker, or authority over a worker.</p> 
<p><strong>System:</strong>&nbsp; an organized or complex whole, whereby the parts (programs and principles) perform in an integrated manner so as to affect the overall purpose of the system (the Policy Statement).</p> 
<p><strong>Worker:</strong>&nbsp; a person who performs work, or supplies services for monetary compensation and includes an employee of Ryerson, and students or other individuals receiving any remuneration from Ryerson.</p> 
<p><strong>Workplace:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;any land, premises, location or thing at, upon, in or near which a worker works.</p> 
<p><strong>Workplace Violence:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;the exercise of physical force by a person against a worker, in a workplace, that causes or could cause physical injury to the worker, an attempt to exercise physical force against a worker, in a workplace, that could cause physical injury to the worker or a statement or behaviour that it is reasonable for a worker to interpret as a threat to exercise physical force against the worker, in a workplace, that could cause physical injury to the worker.</p> 
<p><em>Note: force applied that is authorized by law, is not considered workplace violence.</em></p> 
<h2>Purpose</h2> 
<p>The purpose of the EHS Management System Policy is:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to affect compliance with the legal duty on employers (Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) s.25(2) (j) to develop a written health and safety policy and implement supporting programs;</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in addition, the described EHS System, insofar as it is implemented and maintained current, is the means by which the Board of Governors and the senior officers of Ryerson may comply with their personal legal duties (OHSA s.32) to ensure that Ryerson complies with the OHSA and regulations; and demonstrate their commitment to a duty of care for the learning environment; and</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by formalizing and clarifying the health and safety responsibilities of each individual in the Ryerson community; and detailing specific prudent actions within the system, our individual efforts and shared accountability for due diligence should result in the reduction of injury and illness at Ryerson and the promotion of individual health and well-being.</p> 
<h2>Scope</h2> 
<p>This policy applies, but is not limited to, the Board of Governors, the President, Provost and Vice President, vice presidents, vice provosts, deans and senior directors, chairs, academic directors and managers, principal investigators, research personnel (post doctoral fellows, research associates and research assistants), managers and supervisors, faculty, staff and students.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The University community is made up of students, staff, faculty, instructors, scholars, researchers and a variety of visitors and guests, including, but not limited to, visiting professors and scholars, adjunct professors, guest lecturers and volunteers who are conducting work or activity on behalf of the University.</p> 
<p>While the OHS Act is primarily focused on rights and responsibilities of the employer and employees, the University expressly promotes the health, safety and security of all members of its community through internal policy and measures.</p> 
<h2>Policy Statement</h2> 
<p>The University recognizes that, integral to the attainment of its mandate, is the assurance of a healthy and safe work, learning, research, teaching, living and recreational environment and a community culture of civility in the workplace.</p> 
<p>In achieving this commitment, the University shall do everything reasonably practicable by ensuring that measures are in place to support the internal responsibility system, whereby every member of the community shares responsibility for health and safety, security, harassment prevention and preservation of a civil and respectful environment.</p> 
<p>The University will enable this shared responsibility by integrating EHS due diligence into all planning and decision-making processes, establishing management policies, programs, procedures and practices to identify and address health and safety risks. This includes risks of workplace violence and providing support to our community members who must take appropriate actions for the prevention of illness and injury and response to accidents, incidents, near misses and concerns.</p> 
<p>It is recognized that the University has other policies and agreements in place that pertain to health and safety, including, but not limited to the,</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student Code of Non Academic Conduct,</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrimination and Harassment Prevention policy,</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workplace Civility and Respect Policy,</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe and Secure Campus policy;</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collective Agreements,</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evacuation of University Buildings in the Event&nbsp;of Fire or Other Emergency,</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workplace Hazardous Materials Information&nbsp;System (WHMIS), and</p> 
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, Illness&nbsp;and Disability Management System.</p> 
<p>This policy provides a health and safety management system framework for such policies and related prevention programs.&nbsp; These programs integrate relevant provisions of other University policies, under the authority of the OHS Act and the Employers internal responsibility system.</p> 
<h2>Statements of Principle</h2> 
<p>The following statements of principle are to guide the implementation of the Policy Statement:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The underlying philosophy of Ryerson’s Environmental Health and Safety Management System is that of “internal responsibility”, wherein health and safety hazards can best be dealt within the University itself through communication and cooperation; that is, the responsibility for risk management is shared by the entire Ryerson community.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every individual at Ryerson has the right to work and conduct research, teach, live and participate in recreational activities in a healthy and safe environment, where hazards are identified and managed, including violence and harassment. In turn, is expected that individuals be actively involved in integrating EHS risk management into all their activities.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is recognized that there is a continuum where harassment or incivility can lead to violence if not dealt with appropriately. Therefore, addressing incidents of harassment or incivility in a timely manner is an important preventative measure to reduce incidents of workplace violence.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The achievement of due diligence will be encouraged by the provision of an adequate infrastructure, assurance of core competencies, integration of a comprehensive and adaptable EHS risk management system into all administrative and academic activities and implementation of an EHS system performance audit program.</p> 
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Environmental Health and Safety Management System will be audited through evaluation of the constituent programs of the EHS System, and through evaluation of the performance of each party in the workplace who has specific responsibilities under the EHS System.</p> 
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EHS Management System will be coordinated with Ryerson’s policies and programs regarding the health, safety and security of students, visitors and others who are present at Ryerson but who are not workers within the meaning of health and safety legislation.</p> 
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryerson will develop, implement and maintain current, an Environmental Health and Safety Management System, consisting of specific EHS policies, programs, and guidelines which will fulfill Ryerson’s EHS Management System Policy statement.</p> 
<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2> 
<p>The following statements outline the distribution of authority, responsibility and accountability for EHS throughout the Ryerson community. These arrangements constitute the legal&nbsp;<em><strong>internal responsibility system&nbsp;</strong></em>and supporting resources.</p> 
<p>These measures are the means by which due diligence of the employer, its workers and supervisors, as prescribed under the OHS Act can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>Where students are paid to perform work they become workers under the Ontario OHS Act and therefore have the same rights and responsibilities outlined in this document and the OHS Act.&nbsp; In addition, any individual performing work on university premises, not for pay, but for educational and other purposes that are not prohibited, are considered by the University to have rights and responsibilities under the University EHS Management System and supporting programs.</p> 
<h2>Standards and Guidelines</h2> 
<p>The Department ofIntegrated Risk Management (IRM) integrates, guides and coordinates the efforts of the Ryerson community toward achieving EHS due diligence by researching, developing and applying best practices in risk management.&nbsp; Established as formal University policies, these practices are further refined and articulated through performance standards and guidelines developed and communicated through the Department of Integrated Risk Management (IRM).</p> 
<h2>EHS Performance Review</h2> 
<p>The University’s EHS Audit Program details the criteria and processes for examining health and safety performance at two distinct levels: the management of EHS within specific departments, schools and centres and measurement of the effectiveness of the University due diligence strategy and system.&nbsp; EHS performance is also integrated within the University Internal Audit system.</p> 
<p>In addition to these formal audits which are conducted through the Department of Integrated Risk Management (IRM), reviews of key performance indicators such as accident and near-miss profiles, EHS inspection findings, and core competency levels should be conducted annually by each department, school and centre.</p> 
<p>Performance of EHS responsibilities for each position within the Ryerson community is measured against clearly defined performance indicators, as outlined in the Department of&nbsp;Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Guideline 02-2001&nbsp;<em><a href="/content/dam/ehss/pdfs/NT/UEHS_GL_002_EvalEHSRes_2011.pdf"><span class="sr-only">PDF file</span>Evaluating the Performance of EHS Responsibilities<span aria-hidden="true" class="autoIconLink fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span></a>.</em></p> 
<h2>Jurisdiction</h2> 
<p>This policy falls under the jurisdiction of the Vice President, Administration and Finance. The application and interpretation of the policy is the responsibility of the Department of Integrated Risk Management (IRM).</p>
