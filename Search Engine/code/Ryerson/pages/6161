        <p>&#034;One thing that really stuck with me from my time in ComCult is the invitation to &#034;follow the question&#034; (in the words of Jacqui Alexander) when conducting social research. I found it liberating, and think I did better work, as a result of being encouraged to cross disciplinary boundaries in order to draw on the tools most effective in my line of inquiry, rather than being constrained from the start by a particular set of disciplinary assumptions and methodologies.&#034;</p>

   <td><p><strong>Making Up A Drug Epidemic: Constructing Drug Discourse During the Opioid Epidemic in Ontario</strong><br> Travis Sidak (2020); Supervised by Stephan Muzzatti</p> <p><strong>Thesis: </strong>The current opioid epidemic has resulted in growing rates of overdose across the province with the introduction of fentanyl into illicit drug markets. What barriers are preventing policy makers from enacting emergency measures to save lives and how have those affected by the epidemic been categorically ignored? The following research critically analyzes drug discourse relating to the current opioid epidemic in Ontario and discusses why government responses to the epidemic have been delayed, and why they offer inferior measures to prevent growing mortality and morbidity. Using Ian Hacking’s theory of dynamic nominalism, the work systematically deconstructs drug discourse through a number of perspectives in order to identify stakeholders and manifest relations of power that drive policy deliberation and designate key figures of authority. Research has shown that opioid dependent users are infantilized and demonized due to a history of negative perspectives on drug use that persist today in drug discourse.</p> </td>

However, there is a call to be attentive to the discursive strategies used by Canadian INGOs, and the representations of developing countries emulated to Western aid supporters. This study conducts a critical discourse analysis on three Canadian INGO websites: CARE Canada, International Federation of the Red Cross, and Oxfam Canada. By exploring the discursive frameworks that represent, categorize, and by extension establish sets of relations between INGO audiences and aid receivers, this study gauges the shifts of hegemonic discourses within the context of INGO messaging. An autoethnography is included with each case study, reflecting on my own experiences working with non-profit organizations. <em>Canadian INGOs, online representations, critical discourse analysis, Canadian aid supporters</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>“I Would Do Anything to Not Call This Place Home”: The Black Pill, Involuntary Celibacy, and the Neoliberal Male Grasp in Digital Incel Communities</strong><br> Anthony Burton (2020); Supervised by Greg Elmer</p> <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Drawing from gender studies, critical theory, media studies, and anthropology, this thesis examines “involuntary celibacy” and the links between neoliberalism, masculinity, digital community, and misogyny. Based on an analysis of the webforum incels.co, it chronicles the development of the “incel” identity, situating it as a reaction to contemporary social hierarchies and cultural norms, including the infringement of neoliberal market logic onto social relations and gender stereotypes. The “incel identity” is framed as a site wherein these norms meet and contradict each other, leading to the construction of a group epistemology that attempts to explain the incel’s oppression. This group knowledge, dubbed the “black pill”, is an alternative set of norms, behaviours, and social truths rooted in masculine supremacy and supported through the usage of positivist, scientific claims. This project explores the rationality and sentiments of the black pill, especially as they relate to expressive traits of the body. At its core, this thesis argues that “incel” ideology exposes a contradiction between the neoliberal marketization of the self and contemporary masculinity, and it draws upon this contradiction to formulate a way of understanding the process and practice of digitized community. <em>incel, masculinity, blackpill, involuntary celibacy, forum, phenotype, program, ideology, neoliberalism, gender, red pill, platform</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>The Post-Digital Pensive Image: Reclamation of Subjectivity Within Communicative Capitalism</strong><br> Cody Rooney (2020); Supervised by Shannon Bell</p> <p><strong>Project-Paper: </strong>This paper/project theorizes an epistemological rupture between the scopic regimes of Cartesian Perspectivalism and the “Post-Digital” and how these influence conceptions of reality, identity, and subjectivity. Through an analysis of the progression of perspectivalism from the 15th century to the digital image, the photograph is theorized as operating concomitantly with realism and positivism, and through digital mediation, as having been commodified and weaponized by capitalism for the purposes of subjugating its subject. This subjugation is theorized as producing a pervasive dysphoria, as the simulacrum of reality engendered by digital visuality causes the semiology of reality to dissolve. The “post-digital,” then, serves as a negation of this subjugation through a reflexive and hyper-mediated visuality that employs surrealist strategies to ground the spectator in their own subjectivity. The photographic component is an inquiry into how I, as a digital subject, utilize aesthetic strategies in order to ground my own subjectivity within this paradigm.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>My Master’s Thesis, But It’s a Podcast (About Podcasts)</strong><br> Olivia Trono (2020); Supervised by Jamin Pelkey</p> <p><strong>Project-Paper: </strong>Podcasting is a medium that has become embedded in the everyday lives of millions, increasingly rivaling other forms of media—and yet, research has not kept pace with the proliferation of podcasts. In particular, podcast literature infrequently prioritizes the perspectives of podcast creators and listeners. In My Master’s Thesis, but it’s a podcast (about podcasts), I interview creators and listeners in an effort to identify some of the ways in which podcasts shape individual lives, and broader communities and cultures—and to understand how podcasts serve “to make our selves feel oriented” (Weiner 2014). This 8-episode podcast strives to explore these ideas in a way that is accessible, yet still academic. The research and interviews focus on three overarching (and intersecting) purposes that podcasts serve: allowing for new/renewed forms of storytelling; enabling accessible, creative, and engaging forms of learning-education; and providing listeners with meaningful forms of companionship and community. <em>podcast, podcasting, new media, audio media, accessible media, media studies, research creation, experiential learning, podcast companionship and community, podcast storytelling, podcast learning-education, podcast intimacy, youth and podcasts</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Small Town Creative Communities of Conviviality: a Case Study of Sackville, New Brunswick</strong><br> max cotter (2020); Supervised by Miranda Campbell</p> <p><strong>Project-Paper: </strong>This project uses Sackville, New Brunswick as a case study for small town creative communities, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of small towns for cultural workers, also offering insight into what draws artists to these communities. A tension exists between cultural producers and urban life, as the rising cost of living in cities jeopardizes affordable rent for arts venues and housing for cultural workers. The town of Sackville is home to a liberal arts university, artist-run centres, galleries, music festivals, and many urban expat artists, with a cost of living well below that of cities. Engaging Sackville’s artist population to collect oral histories, this project identifies themes regarding their reasoning for seeking out a small town community. Culminating in an hour-long audio documentary, this project addresses how smaller communities foster creativity, collaboration, and conviviality, and how a lower cost of living and rural landscape impact the cultural producer.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Horses in the Back: Negotiations of Black Identity Through Cowboy Symbolism in American Popular Culture</strong><br> Brigid Savage (2020); Supervised by Susan Driver</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper:</strong> In 2019 Lil Nas X released a country-trap song called “Old Town Road” that challenges the traditional boundaries of American popular music. This research paper examines the creation, maintenance, and subversion of myths in American popular culture through the lens of the song “Old Town Road.” With Roland Barthes’ work on mythologies as the theoretical framework, this research asks the following question: How does Lil Nas X, a young queer Black man, reshape the popular American iconography of the western cowboy in order to reconstruct mainstream popular culture representations? The research draws upon critical theory from a range of fields, including subculture, postcolonial, and intersectional feminist theory. This study finds that Black Americans have been marginalized by American history through racial stereotypes and strict social boundaries. However, through self-representation in music and style Black creators work to actively rewrite the myths of American identity. <em>American cowboy, Black popular culture; hip hop; country music</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>The Cinematic Subterranean: Investigating the Cultural Significance of the Underground Through Film</strong><br> Nicole Payette (2020); Supervised by John McCullough</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper:</strong> Representations of the material underground are dominated by infernal imagery and vast catacombs, fantastic wizards and mythical beasts, sleek climate-controlled bunkers and modern transportation. As a lived space, the underground is home to labourers, socially ostracized populations, revolutionaries, treasure, toxic waste, and dead bodies. The multifariousness of the underground marks the space as a powerful location through which countless narratives, characters, and meanings are manifested. This Major Research Paper provides an initial step in understanding the underground’s cultural significance by primarily focusing on the representations of the subterranean in film. This research begins by determining three main characteristics of the space: marginalization, interment, and utopianism. These characteristics are subsequently analyzed through the genre of horror, specifically Jordan Peele’s Us (2019), which utilizes the monster figure as the embodiment of the repressed/Other to distinguish the underground as a marginal, interring and utopian space. <em>Underground, Space, Film, Horror, Monster, Marginalization</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>An Exploration of Suicide Reporting in Canadian Newspapers</strong><br> Siena Maxwell (2020); Supervised by May Friedman</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper:</strong> This paper explores how two large Canadian newspaper outlets cover and publish cases of suicide over the past 41 years. Utilizing a mad studies lens, this research employs critical discourse analysis to illuminate how a medicalized and individualized model of mental illness has dominated the way we view madness. As a result, the coverage of mad individuals who choose suicide consistently pathologizes and blames them, while reinforcing the notions that mad people are violent, criminal and in need of medical control. Also missing from the dialogue is a discussion and recognition of the role of the social, political, cultural, and economic context in which people become mentally distressed. More recently, self-reflexivity on the part of the journalist has grown, impacting the way cases of suicide are covered and discussed. <em>Suicide, Mad Studies, Neoliberalism, Medical Model, Journalism</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>The Designer’s Contribution to the 3d Knit Ecosystem</strong><br> Kirsten Schaefer (2020); Supervised by Charles Davis</p> <p><strong>Dissertation: </strong>The term 3D knitting is used in popular media and marketing to describe textile products knit in a single, shaped piece, without seams. 3D knit products provide: increased comfort in wearable items, greater product integrity, new design possibilities, reduction in manual labour, and new opportunities to integrate “smart” fibres. Due to the complex machinery and software used for this type of fabrication, designers engaging with 3D knitting require a different mindset compared to traditional cut and sew or knit design processes. This research was framed by the question: What role do designers play in the current 3D knit ecosystem? A secondary question asked: What are the opportunities and challenges in expanding designers’ skills for 3D knitting? Qualitative inquiry was used to examine designers’ experience in the 3D knit ecosystem in Canada and the United States from the perspectives of three primary stakeholders: designers, software technicians (programmers), and production managers (manufacturers). Modified touchstone tours including semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants (n=18) from the three key stakeholder groups at companies (n=10) across Canada and the United States. Thematic analysis was used to identify and organize key themes from the data. Results indicate that 3D knitting provides benefits in five categories: consumer/product, manufacturer, design and development, business strategy, and sustainability. Challenges and roadblocks were identified in four categories for all stakeholders: costs, education and employment, design and development, and communication. Challenges identified by one stakeholder group were frequently mirrored by or connected to the experience of another group. Results suggest that tacit knowledge contributes to the communication bottleneck in the 3D knit ecosystem. As access to 3D knitting increases, designers’ responsibilities and the scope of their considerations in the design and development process must expand. Designers who understand the goals and priorities of the other stakeholder groups are better equipped to successfully navigate the 3D knit design and development process. This research has implications for current practices in textile and apparel production as well as for higher education institutions preparing design students for careers in this evolving industry.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Voter Privacy and the Openness Principle: an Examination of Political Party Privacy Policies in Canada and the United Kingdom</strong><br> Priyana Govindarajah (2020); Supervised by Jeremy Shtern</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper: </strong>Canadian political parties have failed to communicate basic privacy protections to their data subjects in their privacy policies. In order to retain the trust and confidence of the electorate and preserve the integrity of elections, parties must clearly communicate their data practices in their privacy policies and the measures they take to protect personal information. A content analysis is employed to examine the openness principle of privacy policies of federal political parties in the United Kingdom and Canada to assess compliance with an international privacy standard, the OECD privacy framework. This study is timely as protecting personal information and addressing privacy vulnerabilities pertaining to data subjects is vital in the electoral context. Information mismanagement can distort the political and democratic process, as well as interfere with a citizen’s ability to make informed political decisions, hence the need for stronger data protection legislation pertaining to political parties in Canada. <em>Privacy; Privacy Policy; Voter Surveillance; Transparency; Microtargeting; Voter Privacy; Elections; Openness Principle</em></p> </td>

A critical discourse analysis found that lack of credibility and recognition of the listeners’ autonomy complicated the hosts’ authoritative status, oversimplifications of success and disregard for rules and regulations highlighted the hosts’ unacknowledged privilege, and the promotion of self-management and self-surveillance threatened the empowering messaging that the hosts had initially strived for. Each of these findings contribute to broader discourses around intimacy, neoliberalism, and post-feminism. The discussion focuses on productive ways for the hosts to incorporate a variety of perspectives into their advice and to acknowledge their trusted positions as a responsibility. <em>Podcast, Intimacy, Advice, Neoliberalism, Post-Feminism</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Mors Naviculam: the Globalization of Canadian Fashion Through Trade, Policy and Regulation</strong><br> Mark O'Connell (2020); Supervised by Greg Elmer</p> <p><strong>Dissertation: </strong>Canadian Fashion in its current modes of design, production and distribution is deeply integrated into globalized production chains that segment various aspects of manufacturing into disparate locations scattered around the globe. At best, these globalised operations provide jobs and revenue for developing economies, at worst the unregulated sites of production are left wide open for labour abuses that can spell disaster for the workers employed there, and the local environment. The goal of this research is to use the knowledge gained from the close study of fashion objects to illustrate the negative consequences of contemporary fashion production, a manufacturing model that is currently undertaken at the detriment of both workers as well as the environment. Utilizing an object-based research method, one that auto-ethnographises garments and their impacts, the full scope of the impacts of these processes are explored. Research also details the history of how these production models came to be and includes an examination of innovations that are aiming to counter these destructive modes of production as well as possibilities for amelioration. Sustainability (fashionable or otherwise) as a goal is not an ambition that can be achieved in a vacuum. The processes that create an unsustainable environment for manufacturing and production are directed and mediated by various social actors, they range from consumer preference, economic directives, as well as access to retail, manufacturing and labour markets. All of the actions of these competing mediating forces are synthesized into public policy. Governmental regulations on how production is undertaken locally, and the parameters for import and export are all set according to the general public will. It is this will (for good or ill) that will shape the future of Canadian fashion manufacturing. <em>Fashion sustainability; Canadian fashion economy; Canadian fashion history; Globalization of fashion manufacturing</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Mediated Landscapes: Technology and Environment in Recent Canadian Cinema</strong><br> Daniel Browne (2020); Supervised by Monique Tshofen</p> <p><strong>Dissertation: </strong>A central defining feature of the contemporary era is an environmental crisis that has been triggered by the relationship of human-developed technologies to the natural world, which is leading us towards conditions of increasing collapse that will impact all future understandings of our era’s cultural production and experience. This crisis has led many to propose that the planet has entered a new geologic epoch, the “Anthropocene,” in which boundaries between humanity, nature, and technology have become blurred and no longer viable. In this dissertation, I explore this ecological crisis as a manifestation of mythological and perceptual frameworks that structure contemporary modes of experience, by examining how Canadian filmmakers are responding to such conditions through their artworks. Drawing on Marshall McLuhan’s notion of art as a “counter-environment” that, in its most potent capacity, acts as a “liaison between biology and technology” ([1973] 2003a, 207) or “Distant Early Warning system,” I explore how many recent Canadian films prioritize process, hybridity, decay, and transmutation to reveal the environmental status of media, developing new myths and metaphors that address the crisis of imagination that I argue is at the root of the environmental crisis. Through these approaches, the binaries between humanity, technology, and nature are revealed as false dualisms that have always been united within a greater ecological matrix—an insight that reflects the holistic study of media developed by the Toronto School of Communication. The environmental crisis cannot be resolved through any singular response, but rather necessitates a proliferation of new forms of critical thought, empathy, and modes of experience. Accordingly, in this study I explore a range of aesthetic approaches to interrogate forms of critical visuality in cinema that articulate the environmental invisibility of media, including narrative, documentary, and experimental works. These examples are united by a framework that seeks to cultivate perceptual sensitivities through revelatory forms over discursive approaches. By revealing the strong affinities between Canadian art and critical theory, I demonstrate how cinema can provide a fertile terrain for critiquing technological environments and their influence upon notions of embodiment, the natural world, and the shaping force of language.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>The Virtual Capriccio: the Semiotics of Architecture in Digital Games</strong><br> Garbriele Aroni (2020); Supervised by Bruno Lessard</p> <p><strong>Dissertation: </strong>Digital games are among the most popular media on the planet, and billions of people inhabit such virtual worlds daily. Most of these worlds are made of virtual buildings, roads, and cities that players travel through. This dissertation aims to fill a gap in the game studies literature regarding the architecture of digital games, in terms of both its aesthetic aspect and its symbolic role as they relate to gameplay. It strives to answer the following questions: how does the design of virtual architecture influence gameplay and storytelling through its communicative aspect? How does digital architecture relate to real architecture? Where does the inspiration for digital games architecture come from? In order to answer these questions, this dissertation examines how architecture is used in digital games, how players interact with it, and what it communicates. The dissertation thus analyses the architecture of digital games through the lenses of semiotics and architecture theory, mainly the research pursued by Umberto Eco as regards the semiotics of architecture and by Brian Upton with his theory of “anticipatory play.” It presents case studies of digital games grouped in three categories: reconstructive, fantastic, and visionary. Reconstructive virtual architecture, as evidenced in Assassin’s Creed II (2009), aims to recreate existing locales, be they from the present or the past, with the intent to immerse the player in a simulated environment that is as close as possible to reality. Fantastic virtual architecture, represented by the Japanese game Final Fantasy XV (2016), is the category that arguably encompasses the vastest number of digital games, as it comprises the type of architecture designed to appear, if not realistic, at least plausible, and bears resemblance to real-world architecture. Finally, the category of visionary virtual architecture, as found in the independent game NaissanceE (2014), while still representing plausible and not completely abstract features, is meant to be perceived as an “impossible” construct. Through these case studies, the dissertation outlines how architecture plays a central role in digital games design, and proposes a semiotic framework for the analysis of virtual architecture that can be applied to the vast majority of digital games.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Ambiguity and Irreconcilability: A Critical Look at Reconciliation Discourse in Federal Land Claims and Self-Government Political Communications</strong><br> Rebecca Hume (2020); Supervised by Paul Moore and Julie Tomiak</p> <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Can reconciliation be meaningful when it is at once a journey, a path, a milestone, a framework, a tool of economic development, a spirit, and a process? In this thesis, I use a multimethod approach to problematize how reconciliation discourse is employed ambiguously in both policy and practice in order to maintain settler colonial occupation of stolen Indigenous lands. I first conduct a policy review of federal land claims and self-government frameworks before turning to a Critical Discourse Analysis of public communications to illustrate the limitations of these state-led processes of reconciliation. My analysis elucidates the ways in which these processes are instantiations of settler governmentality that continue to exist as common sense (Rifkin, 2013) within a discursive framework of state-led reconciliation politics. As such, my work demonstrates that in order to work towards the bigger project of decolonization and resurgence, reconciliation must move from purely aspirational terms to substantive, treaty-based responsibilities with the repatriation of Indigenous land as its overarching, incommensurable purpose. <em>Keywords: reconciliation politics; settler colonialism; Crown-Indigenous relations; critical policy studies; critical discourse analysis.</em></p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Kazimir Malevich: Approaching the New System</strong><br> Irina Lyubchenko (2020); Supervised by R. Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation: </strong>This dissertation examines Kazimir Malevich’s art and writing with a view to establishing that they combine a strain of strict methodological reductionism with an equally well-marked esotericism. It strives to prove that although this feature of Malevich’s work was common among vanguard artists and thinkers, there are also highly idiosyncratic qualities in the way Malevich reconciled these two threads. An ensuing goal of this work is to propose how to complete an unfinished 1927 film script by Kazimir Malevich titled “Artistic and Scientific Film—Painting and Architectural Concerns—Approaching the New Plastic Architectural System.” The question regarding the confluence of science and mysticism in Malevich’s work— the primary concern of this dissertation—requires tracing in the artist’s art and writings the presence of ideas belonging to these worldviews traditionally considered to be antithetical to each other. This dissertation establishes Malevich’s relationship with mysticism and strains of thought that resemble scientific content and approach. Among the latter, this work investigates Malevich’s interest in the geometry of the fourth dimension, draws parallels between the artist’s concern for visualizing infinity and the problems of set theory, and examines the role of imaginary numbers in Malevich’s worldview. To complete the analysis of Malevich’s exploration of the concept of space prominent in the aforementioned mathematical themes, this dissertation examines the artist’s interest in investigating the space of the cosmos. It also establishes that Malevich’s ideas were not only influenced by the scientific advancements in electromagnetism but also by the theories of thermodynamics, which together with the former relay a view of the world where all processes, organic and inorganic, are understood as the product of the transformation of energy. In Cubism and Futurism: Spiritual Machines and the Cinematic Effect, R. Bruce Elder draws attention to the early twentieth-century thinkers’ view of cinema as an electromagnetic machine. This dissertation examines Malevich’s relationship with the cinematic art and its reception in Russia during Malevich’s most productive years. This work concludes with having satisfied its larger objective: to envision a possible scenario of how Malevich’s unfinished script could unfold. It contains the copy of the original script, its proposed finale, and an essay that outlines how my investigation of Malevich’s intellectual landscape informed the decisions involved in inferring the concluding shot sequences of the artist’s only cinematic work.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Toronto’s Little Shop of Horrors: a Cultural Criminology Examination on Serial Killer Bruce McArthur and the News Media</strong><br> Emma Margaret Smith (2020); Supervised by Stephen Muzzatti</p> <p><strong>Dissertation: </strong>Contributing to the dynamic and interdisciplinary field of cultural criminology, this project works to emphasize the destructive, modern forces of consumerism and violence within Toronto’s crime-news industry. The paper fuses the canonical and emerging methodologies of content analysis, discourse analysis, and liquid ethnography, to evaluate the framing and editing techniques used to relay the story of Bruce McArthur’s predations in The Village (over the 2018 news year). A sample of 365 articles, retrieved from five print media sources, are methodically examined to understand both the local and national agenda-setting strategies of contemporary journalism. Actively contributing to the transformation of human suffering and violence into mass-market pleasure, a carnival of crime model (Presdee, 2000) serves as a primary lens for evaluating the hyper-sensationalized reporting styles of modern news makers. Weaving theoretical contributions from the fields of sociology and media studies, the embeddedness of heteronormative, racialized, and ethnocentric tropes common to the news and crime-infotainment industries is also critically evaluated towards raising greater political and social accountability. Crime-centric podcasts are further identified as a leading technological medium for fueling public obsessions with murder and transgressions. Formed by enthusiastic hobbyists and motivated journalists, the producers of podcasting content hastily straddle the realms of entertainment and information sharing. As such, this research calls for immediate awareness and tending to the neoliberal symptoms of boredom and fear existing in our modern world, building on Stanley Cohen’s (1972) moral panic theory.

   <td><p><strong>#neverenough: Social Comparison by Young Women on Instagram</strong><br> Bailey Parnell (2020); Supervised by Anatoliy Gruzd</p> <p><strong>Thesis: </strong>As social media use continues to rise, studies have linked high social media use with rising levels of depression, particularly in young adults. This narrative has pervaded, yet in the research thus far, there is no general consensus as to causation or direction. What remains constant is that when mediators such as ‘comparison’ and ‘envy’ are introduced between social media use and depression, there is a negative correlation. In a qualitative study, I examine the connection between social comparison, Instagram use, and envy in young women. I conducted semi-structured interviews with a group of 10 female university students between the ages of 18-24. Interviews were analysed through qualitative descriptive analysis. Overwhelmingly, subjects engaged in frequent social comparison offline, which translated to frequent social comparison, made worse, on Instagram. As a result, participants admitted to feeling envious as well as other feelings like frustration, loneliness, anger, and overwhelm. However, users also reported positive experiences such as inspiration, humour, motivation, and happiness, when they are on Instagram. Offline affect proved to be the biggest moderators and indicators of comparison and the positive or negative experiences of the participants. This research may suggest future care in this area should focus on offline affect rather than the social networks themselves.</p> </td>

Since research suggests that virtual reality (VR) can generate heightened empathetic response in users, I chose to develop my story using VR as the primary creative tool. This study required engagement with the creative and methodological approaches of arts-based research—a process of learning-by-making that prompts questions and reflections on ethics, techniques, aesthetics, value, and subjectivity. The finished project, then, is an exploration of my journey not only as a single mother, but also as a researcher exploring emerging technological affordances and their capacity to engender empathy and serve as tools of autobiographical expression. In this way, the work could further be understood as contributing to the emerging field of autotheory, in which the researcher’s subjective and embodied experience is integrated with theoretical and philosophical approaches.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>Lingo-Entrainment: the Natural Language Surveillance of Smartphone Users</strong><br> Nicholas Fazio (2020); Supervised by Steve Bailey</p> <p><strong>Thesis: </strong>This thesis examines the neuro-cultural implications of: (1) language capture and commodification; and (2) neurological entrainment, two processes that I contend have coextensively emerged with the development of smartphones in a way that is profitable for major smartphone manufacturers and privileged third parties. The phrase “neurological entrainment” in this context refers specifically to the smartphone’s ability to exert affective behavioural control over smartphone users by altering their neurochemical states. I aim to situate this established neurological phenomenon alongside a less scrutinized transformation: that of the smartphone into a site of language-capture. By “language capture” I refer to the intake, collection and brokering of smartphone users’ natural language data and metadata. The goal of this thesis is to contextualize the interfusing of these entrainment and capture processes that cunningly form lucrative linguistic relationships between smartphone users and their devices. This study, through a comparative content analysis of data policies, privacy protocols, and privacy related promotional material pertaining to two major smartphone manufacturers (e.g., Apple and Samsung), substantiates the claim that the foundational documents of each device openly permit this productive union, with its doubled effect of neurological pacification and linguistic divestment. It also situates these findings within the grander lingo-entrainment systems that influence the future of our living language, and that coincide with Deleuzian premonitions about societies of control.</p> </td>

Telecommunications services are becoming increasingly essential for Canadian citizens to effectively participate in the economy, democracy and society more broadly. As such, it is critical to explore the various policy mechanisms that can deliver all Canadians an affordable and high quality experience as mandated in section seven of the Telecommunications Act. The study focuses on potential ways to cultivate a meaningfully competitive telecommunications environment that can better represent public interest. Drawing on a litany of international and domestic regulatory decisions, both past and present, in conjunction with academic journals, Candian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission (CRTC) regulatory proceedings and contemporary news articles, the paper demonstrates that the lack of meaningful competition in the Canadian telecommunications industry is limiting positive outcomes for Canadian citizens in regards to affordability, choice and coverage.</p> </td>

   <td><p><strong>The Role of Canadian National Print Media in Fostering Positive Public Opinion Towards the Legislation of Same-Sex Marriage in Canada</strong><br> Amanda Piche (2020); Supervised by Art Blake</p> <p><strong>Dissertation</strong>: Since the Charter of Rights and Freedoms emerged in 1982, Canadian national print news was central to the complex networks in the establishment of same-sex marriage in 2005. Newspapers framed marriage equality as a human rights’ issue, within conventions for balance and objectivity. However, LGBTQrelated issues have not consistently been approached this way by the media, which have traditionally created and regulated boundaries of gender and sexuality (Rubin 2007). This dissertation explores why Canadian mainstream press oscillated between anti-queer and pro-LGBTQ approaches in a post-Charter Canada and its effect on public opinion. I show how news reporting is symbiotically implicated in Canadian public perspectives through public sphere theory (Habermas 1989; Fraser 1992). Frame analysis demonstrates how the issue was ideologically positioned in print (Goffman, 1974; Entman 1993; McCombs 2004; Scheufele 1999, 2000). A content analysis of over 2,000 national newspaper articles published between 1982 and 2005 reveal the frames used in stories about marriage equality. Semi-structured interviews with journalists and activists contextualize the analysis. Responses determine how media frames may have implicated understanding and support of the issue, and why and how certain frames were decided by journalists. This work informs the history of LGBTQ rights in Canada by exploring how the national news industry contributed to the framing of marriage equality. Analyses of news coverage of marriage equality remains largely US-centric (Brewer 2002 &amp; 2003; Tadlock, et. al, 2007; Liebler et al., 2009; Li and Liu, 2010; Pan et al. 2010). Research on framing marriage equality in Canada focuses on litigants (Smith 2007), courts (Matthews 2005), and newspapers in 2003 and 2004 (Bannerman 2012). Despite several studies concerning the politics of sexual diversity in Canada (Hogg 2006; Kinsman 1996; Kinsman and Gentile 2010; Pettinicchio 2010; Rayside 2008; M. Smith 2008, 2012), marriage equality has not been studied extensively.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </td>

The advent of mobile technology and social media platforms gave an antidote to this problem. Particularly, vlogging trend among Muslim women lets them disrupt problematic narratives about themselves, speak in their own voices to a global audience and demonstrate their agency. However, the women’s focus on fashion puts them at the mercy of cultural and profit-driven norms. Their use of YouTube also means the vloggers are unconsciously conforming to prevailing trends. This research applies a feminist CDA to illuminate ideologies that shape the women’s articulation of their identities in relation to their ethno-religious communities. The small stories approach of interviews with Muslim women vloggers unearthed this trend’s liberative qualities and pitfalls. Since digital self-representation among marginalized identities like Muslim women is new, this research calls for further research into the utility of digital platforms as tools for identity articulation. <em>Hijab (Islamic clothing) -- Social aspects; Muslim women; Identity Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Using a partial structural analysis of both stations (which considers ownership, financing and station-goal-setting) in conjunction with critical cultural analysis (based on surveys and four in-depth interviews), this thesis demonstrates that in addition to the formation of cultural identities, diasporic media provides opportunities for the development of community dialogue and participation in media production. In essence, this project suggests that watching third-language television is not simply about long-distance nostalgia or entertainment; rather it is about the desire to remain an informed citizen and comparatively reflect on how customs and cultural narratives—in what they consider to be their homeland—are evolving alongside their current lifestyles. <em>Cultural anthropology; Mass media; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Ontario Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

The television show Amos ‘n’ Andy (1951-1953) will be examined in regards to its portrayal of African American males as unintelligent, feeble minded, and objects of mockery when paired with Caucasian characters, while Diff’rent Strokes (1980- 1986) and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air (1990-1996) will be used as examples of sitcoms that use the practice of pairing Caucasian males and obedient Black males with ill-mannered inner city Black men in order to alter their negative traits and turn them into civilized gentlemen, suitable for a predominantly white audience. The reference to All in the Family (1971-1979) will examine how the series’ use of comedy to confront racism overshadows it’s re-enactment of colonial practices.

According to one school of thought, the media serve the interests of the dominant class, functioning as a "government propaganda machine". The key argument here is that the government sets the agenda on foreign policy issues as a result of a set of structural factors: (1) media project and protect the interests of ruling class, (2) media reliance on government sources, (3) corporate influence on media, (4) government's media management strategies, (5) government regulations, (6) secrecy or denial of access to information, (7) automatic attention to statements by president and administration officials. The contrary school of thought maintains that the news media are an independent force, serving as a critic/watchdog or fourth branch of government. According to this argument, the media have considerable power to influence government policies (both domestic and foreign) by criticizing the weakness of policies and influencing the policy agenda. This perspective is reflected in studies of the "CNN effect", which conclude that media play significant role in setting the public agenda and policy options. The thesis of this study is that the media's role is best seen as "contributor" in the policy making process: (1) the media provides useful information, suggestions and criticism that help in shaping policy; (2) policymakers need media to organize public support for their policy line; (3) media influence sometimes itself was the consequence of official actions; (4) media positions on foreign policy are taken more seriously by American policymakers after the fall of Soviet Union, because post cold war foreign policy decisions has no longer been taken in the context of the global containment of communism; (5) the new communication technologies have enabled media to cover event or crises in real time, putting more pressure on policymakers to respond to issues promptly for organizing public opinion in the favor of the government policy line. In addition, the globalization of communication flow and the advance of communication technologies have increased the interaction between media and policymakers. Thus, government and media influence each other in the policymaking process. <em>Political science; Mass media; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Foreign policy; Media; News media; Pakistan Media and Culture;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

At the intertextual level, popular Turkish film parodies of the twenty-first century expose and ridicule a discourse of modernity by creating a critical intertextuality with classical Turkish film genres of the 1960s and popular Hollywood cinema in the new millennium. The use of critical intertextuality can be essential as a discursive tool to reconstruct a national cinema's genres and to understand its changing viewer modality through a historical perspective. Through looking at how film parody reinterprets genre films this study also identifies a new mode of film and media production in Turkey. The new televisual production regime replaced the old Yesilcam production regime of the 1960s that aspired to be like the American cinema but failed to do so due to financial, organizational and technical reasons. Today Turkish cinema is thriving with parody films and through these parody films new Turkish cinema wants to show off its newfound technical proficiency and by doing so expose and reverse the intertextual power relationships between Turkish cinema and American cinema. Turkish film parodies act as important discursive vehicles for representing aspects of modernity in their narrative.

Whether for training, course work or overseas deployment, CF members can be absent from their families for weeks, or several months at a time as required for military service. My thesis documentary video, Canadian Forces Deployments: A Family Experience provides a glimpse of military families' experiences of deployment of a CF member to Afghanistan. The objective of this video is to provide a representation of the subgroup of military families that differs from the common mainstream media representations of soldiers fighting in Afghanistan who have been or are absent. The basis of this project is ethnographic research, conducted through interviews with spouses of Canadian Forces' members who are either currently deployed in the overseas mission in Afghanistan; who have recently returned; or who are awaiting deployment. This project provides an overview of the military lifestyle of members and their families and the general context for deployments. In comparison to past CF missions, greater concern and risk accompanies current deployments of Canadian Forces members as Canada is engaged in a combat role in the politically unstable country of Afghanistan. Through on-camera interviews with spouses of CF members, this documentary provides a representation that is different than commonly found in mainstream media where military families are often depicted solely in grief and mourning. This project stems from my personal acquaintance with the Canadian Forces and military lifestyle, growing up with my father who was an officer in the regular force.

Drawing lessons from biology and ethology, Brooks designs embodied, responsive robots that he provocatively calls "artificial creatures." He has also been vocal about the broad implications his research carries for the future, making bold predictions about a technological society increasingly shaped by ecologies of animated machines. This dissertation examines a number of popular and academic texts in which Brooks discusses his artificial creatures, his design methodology, and his futurological speculations. Focusing on key moments from these texts, I discuss how he constructs a rhetorical and narrative framework through which he ascribes a sense of "life" to his robots in order to probe the distinction between the living and the nonliving and deliberately unsettle the bounds of the biological and the technological. As he highlights the lifelike qualities of his robots that raise them to the status of creatures, he simultaneously emphasizes the machine-like qualities of human beings, leading him to charge people with "overanthropomorphizing" themselves. I argue that these contrapuntal shifts call into question models of subjectivity derived from modern liberal humanism, insofar as they destabilize traditional relations between machines, animals, and human beings. In order to develop the broader theoretical implications of Brooks' work, I engage in comparative readings that place him in dialogue with philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Bernard Stiegler, Jacques Derrida, and René Descartes, early cyberneticists Norbert Wiener and W. Grey Walter, and an offbeat video game called Chibi Robo! These readings afford opportunities to challenge modes of thinking and acting that assume human mastery over nature and technology, and subsequently to reevaluate our intimate connections to nonhuman beings that make human life livable in the first place. Ultimately, I endeavour to lay the groundwork for a bioethics that is responsive to redefinitions of life by technological means, one that eschews anthropocentrism in order to suggest a concern for different ways of living and belonging between humans and nonhumans, rather than for the lives of human beings alone. <em>artificial creatures; bioethics; cybernetics; humanism; human/nonhuman relationship; Rodney Brooks; technology.

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> My goal is not to analyse the sacred – to analyse it is to kill it. The objective is only to explore different ways of approaching the sacred through looking deeply at the nature of poetic language. In our contemporary society, the sacred is the other. And so is the feminine. Our culture often rejects these modes of experience, but poetic practice gives them both a time and a space. My overall argument is that poetic practice creates an approach, a site and a possibility for the sacred to manifest itself phenomenologically by breaking through from the other realm into human experience. Poetic practice holds an intention, creates a direction, a dimension, a state that can approach the experience of the sacred and honour it, be open to it, invite it and allow the subject to suspend the habitual control and instead adopt a surrender mode. Thus, poetic practice itself becomes a sacred activity that teaches us about different kinds of knowledge, experience and insight and invites us to experience a different mode of being in the world, in language, with ourselves, and with each other. Instead of detachment and alienation that permeate our culture, instead of separation from and the resulting objectification of nature, poetic consciousness offers us a more primal mode of being that pre-modern man used to call sacred. <em>bpNichol; communication; feminine; human experience; language; otherness; perception; phenomenology; poetic; poetic consciousness; poetic practice; self; subjectivity; the sacred.

As a growing trend, more Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Canada are intervening with the infrastructure of the Internet by utilizing traffic management practices, such as bandwidth 'throttling'1, which hinder a user's ability to quickly access certain types of content online. Internet traffic management practices (ITMP) are a means for ISPs to control their 'congested'2 networks, with the aim of optimizing or improving their network's performance, or they can often aid in increasing usable bandwidth (Lithgow, 2011). Traffic management practices ultimately allow one kind of 'packet'3 to be delayed over another; for example, ISPs often use a program called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), which is a program that can identify forms of traffic online, meaning it can target specific applications. Since ITMPs can target specific 'packets' online, smaller interest groups, and businesses became increasingly concerned that network neutrality policy principles, such as 'common-carriage'4 was not being enforced by the CRTC. This paper will identify the main concerns of utilizing ITMP on broadband networks, and will illustrate that ITMP can and should be connected to the discussion regarding network neutrality in Canada <em>Canada; Canadian access to media; Canadian internet users; Canadian Radio Television Commission (CRTC); communication policy; internet neutrality; Internet Management Traffic Management Practices; public policy.

The research questions are: What roles do community media play in the lives of Caribbean-Canadians in Toronto?; How do Caribbean Canadians access these media to tell their stories or hear their voice?; How do these media outreach to the large Caribbean Canadian community in Toronto?; How do they describe the relationship that they have with CHRY 105.5FM and CKLN 88.1 FM; and, Do these media affirm the marginalized status of Caribbean Canadians, or are they sites of transformation for Caribbean Canadians daring to contest their exclusion from mainstream radio? These radio stations readily accommodate people, including many on the margins, who are not represented in mainstream media - the public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), or private commercial radio stations. They are the employers of many immigrants, mainly volunteers, who face barriers because of their Caribbean accents, lack of a Canadian accent, and the lack of "Canadian experience". The 'othering' of these immigrants has pushed/pulled them to these community-based campus radio stations where they find a voice to challenge oppressive systems from outside and within. These are community enhancing spaces where the Caribbean diaspora will hear familiar genres of music - reggae, soca, calypso, ragga, zouk - and accents/languages (Spanish, French, Creole) of the multicultural and multilingual Caribbean diaspora in Toronto. <em>Canada; Canadian broadcasting; Caribbean; Toronto; community radio; campus radio; identity; identity formation; immigrant; multiculturalism; radio broadcasting.

Revisioning ‘publicness’ at the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto</strong><br> Susan Ashley (2011);</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> Contemporary museums are repositioning themselves in society, seeking new roles, new audiences and new activities, but in their search for new purpose, the 'public' nature of their institutional role appears to be in retreat. This dissertation critically examines the multi-layered concept of 'publicness' in relation to museums as communicative public institutions, using as a case study the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) a museum of natural history and world cultures in Toronto, Canada. It interrogates how the public nature of the ROM is changing as it completes a multi-million dollar 'Renaissance' architectural project and adopts a new vision of 'public engagement' with the museum as 'agora'. This dissertation argues that the new public vision for the ROM is a rhetorical one, a case of 'in public' celebrity that has promised relevance and engagement, but that has not has been implemented in practice. The research presented here closely inspects the mission, structure, corporate positioning, and public exhibitions and programs of the ROM today, documenting how 'publicness' is reflected in attitudes and behaviors of management, staff and visitors. It assesses how the architectural and operational changes during the Renaissance project have reshaped museum and visitor practices. A confusion of attitudes and priorities regarding the museum's public mission and communicative activities was discovered within the organization. Boundaries were found to persist between ideas of 'publicness' that served corporate interests and practices, and the needs and concerns of 'the public', a divide argued to be the very essence of celebrity publicness. Particular attention is paid to understanding whether publicness in the sense of democratic acts and social change is part of the vision of 'public engagement' promoted by the ROM. Evidence was found in marginal locations, outside of formal museum practices, of engagements that emphasized dialogic relationships and material interactions — in stranger sociability, in interactive volunteer practices, and in small displays and activities with external collaborations. This dissertation argues that achieving 'publicness' in the sense of bridging, dialogue and democratic encounter would require internal not superficial change to the ROM's organizational culture, the removal of boundaries between rhetoric and deeds, between management and workers, and between inside and outside. <em>Organizational behavior; Mass communications; Museum studies </em></p> </td>

For the purposes of this report, heritage is defined as the cultural legacy, including tangible and intangible histories and practices, that is handed down from the past within a community, and which is an essential element of an individual's and a community's sense of identity. Museums operate as sites where people experience and learn about their heritage. But a central concern is how these public institutions encompass marginalized groups within this construction of heritage, identity and community. The focal point of those interactions between museums and people is their exhibitions. This essential communicative tool of museums, this media of production and consumption of meaning, is the point of interest for this paper. As the place where the interests of both sides of the communicative exchange converge, exhibitions reveal the tensions within the system, and the process by which changing ideas about heritage and community are negotiated. Exhibits can be seen as texts anchored in the contexts and processes of their production and reception. Or they can be seen as the dialogic space in which a political relationship unfolds. This paper offers insights into how the political nature of communicative practices underlying the production and consumption of museum exhibitions affects the heritage of marginalized groups. How exhibitions come into being - their modes of production - how they communicate as texts and how they are used or read is illuminated, using as a case study a particular museum exhibit about African-Canadians entitled The Underground Railroad: Next Stop Freedom. Developed by the Department of Canadian Heritage to be displayed in Toronto, the exhibit was installed at the Royal Ontario Museum in 2002 and is currently on view at Black Creek Pioneer Village. The research encompasses the circuit of communication as it relates to the conditions surrounding the conceptualizing and negotiation of this exhibition: what is presented, why it is presented, how it is presented, to whom, and how it is received. <em>Museum exhibits; Social aspects; Minorities; Museum exhibits; Ontario; Toronto; Case studies; Museum exhibits; Public opinion </em></p> </td>

The period of 2000 to 2009 saw a range of disparate solutions, from legalization to abolition, debated by policy makers and feminists and covered extensively in the news media. The debates raised questions about the public's rights, the treatment of prostitution as a legitimate form of work in the liberal economy, the limits on women's choice to enter sex work, and the extent of violence and harm experienced by sex workers. Definitions of prostitution are enacted via a complex relationship between legal and cultural discourses. The media uses certain tropes that create discursive boundaries in the debates. The first principal research question is, "How are competing discourses of prostitution conveyed in contemporary British news media?" The project provides an empirical analysis of the competing constructions of prostitution in British news media over the last decade, focusing on the depiction of sex workers, clients and the phenomenon of prostitution generally. Previous operationalizations of Habermas' theory of communication suggest that it is an effective approach for revealing distortions in media discourses. The study operationalized the validity claims of Truth, Sincerity and Legitimacy and systematically applied them to a sample of 342 articles from The Daily Mail and The Guardian, theoretically representing both the popular political right- and left-leaning framings of issues. Key findings of this project were that many media discourses are distorted compared to empirical realities, and that they are often expressed in dualisms and dichotomies. Media constructions of prostitution also reflect long-standing cultural themes. Nineteenth-century discourses of prostitutes as "fallen" -- simultaneously doomed victims and immoral seducers -- also appeared in many of the media characterizations of sex workers today. Finally, the dissertation argues that the neo-Victorian novels of Michel Faber and Sarah Waters consider prostitution with particular attention of the persistent historical cultural tropes. A second key finding of the project is that literature provides alternative ways of conceptualizing questions of "choice" and "harm." By including an examination of literature, the dissertation explores alternative, more nuanced perspectives that may allow superior understandings of the phenomenon than many of the "factual" media accounts. <em>British news media; feminism; literary criticism; literature; media representations of prostitution; Michael Faber; Neo-Victorian novel; prostitution; United Kingdom; Sarah Waters; sex workers; Victorian age.

In digital technologies of globalization like the Internet, they have found the space and channel of expression even as they negotiate belonging in the host community. Among others, this qualitative study found that the subjects have converted the Internet into a tool of seeing and re-creating the homeland, no longer as a place that inhabits the dreams, fantasies and imaginations, but a place that can be experienced in real time though devoid of physical presence. With transnational merchandizing at the core of this process and anchor of the re-created virtual homeland, this thesis argues that distance and dislocation are increasingly inconsequential when diasporas are determined to maintain their fixed and originary cultural identities. <em>Cultural anthropology; Web Studies; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Ontario Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Three international frameworks that play a key role in recognizing TMK in the international arena are the Convention on Biological Diversity, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the World Health Organization. By examining the way in which these three bodies have recognized and integrated TMK into their respective regimes, while and drawing on the scholarship of anthropologists, critical legal scholars, intellectual property experts and legal and policy literature, I will argue that the recognition of TMK in the international legal and political arena has led to the creation of complex legal and political spaces where recognizing traditional medicinal knowledge has fragmented it, siphoning off the social, cultural and spiritual aspects of it that remain incompatible with the current neoliberal paradigms. Simultaneously, recognition and integration have been used to co-opt traditional knowledge in order to extend governance regimes that integrate TMK and its holders without challenging the basic, outdated and highly unequal and unethical power relations on discourses of recognition are based. <em>Traditional medicine; Cultural property; Indigenous peoples; intellectual property; Convention on Biological Diversity Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

I seek to propose, in spite of the commonly cited iconoclasm of the text, an alternative reading of it as an old-fashioned bildungsroman concerned with the possibilities of moral and spiritual growth. In particular, I illuminate the unconventional way Wallace reimagines classic narratives of redemption and salvation under the surface of the novel, and I develop a framework with which to understand their centrality. Furthermore, I address how this belongs to his larger attempts to reconcile many of the traditional thematic concerns of the novel with several of the challenges presented by the postmodern avant-garde. I argue that, in its efforts to do so, Infinite Jest helped to renew, in many powerful and unexpected ways, the classic story of redemption and offer a profound meditation on many larger ills plaguing society today. <em>bildungsroman; David Foster Wallace; infinite jest; postmodern avant-garde; redemptive narrative.

Adoption of the automobile was challenged by unfamiliarity and unwillingness to share the roads. Automobile races helped increase familiarity and popularity of the automobile. Additionally, racing offered economic benefits to communities wishing to attract investment or tourism. I theorize that automobile races held from 1909-1913 in Galveston, Texas after a category-four hurricane, improved the local economy, subsequently improving attitudes of acceptance toward the automobile. Through a mixed-methods approach, my study looks at the period of early automobile rejection and adoption. I examine historic materials, films, and conduct a case study on the Galveston Beach races.

I began to focus on how consumerism connects with local and global political struggles for human rights and also on the construction and privileges of my perspective. This examination included many readings, but also educational workshops in media and cultural literacy and several creative projects. The mixture of this reflection and action has helped reconnect my interest in consumer culture and advertising in ways I never could have imagined or learned second-hand.

More recently there has been an increase in the adoption of smartphones by corporations; what is not very well understood is their use within meetings. In this dissertation I present quantitative and qualitative data from two online surveys conducted two years apart on the type of smart mobile devices used in meetings, and the attitudes and behaviours of meeting participants towards their usage. The results from the two surveys included four key findings: (1) meeting participants believed that multitasking with a mobile device was a commonly adopted activity; (2) participants took a more accepting attitude towards using certain mobile devices (specifically laptops) in meetings; (3) it was somewhat acceptable to make work-related calls or send text messages regarding work-related emergency matters using smartphones during meetings; and (4) individuals in management tended to think that making important work-related calls during meetings was acceptable. Furthermore, from a list of six types of departments, the operations department tended to rate texting important work-related messages during meetings as acceptable compared with other departments. After reviewing the data from surveys I and II, it was determined that more detailed data were required to observe people’s actual behaviours in live meetings. As a result, a study was devised to simulate a meeting scenario in which one individual would receive and send text messages. Eight video recordings of meeting participants were captured and analyzed to assess their resulting attitudes and behaviours. In four of the meetings text messages arrived in two clusters (i.e., five text messages at the beginning and three at the end of the meeting), while for the remaining four meetings text messages arrived evenly distributed throughout the meeting. The data from those meetings suggest that the participants in the evenly distributed text messages group of meetings interacted with their mobile devices more often but on a less obtrusive level by checking their phone status. The participants in the clustered grouping of text messages group of meetings tended to produce more negative comments (verbal and non-verbal) regarding the actor and their own phone usage. When the actor received a text message, participants tended to give a negative non-verbal gesture, such as gazing at him, or when participants used their own mobile phones they tended to provide a verbal justification of their own use. <em>Smartphones; Organizational behavior; Human behavior; Employees; Attitudes; Cell phone systems; Social aspects </em></p> </td>

I argue that the film spectator has been a major trope in post-revolutionary Cuban discourse and expresses both the political urgency to "see" the nation through "revolutionary" eyes, as well as the difficulties and contradictions inherent in coming to terms, visually and consciously, with such a radical social transformation. Using theories of the public sphere, national cinema, and psychoanalysis as theoretical frameworks, and employing discourse analysis, textual analysis and reception study as research methods, I argue that Cuban film and film discourse are sites of revolutionary "excess" that reveal the promises and contradictions inherent in the revolutionary subjects articulated by the Cuban revolution. My first case study examines the expansion of Cuba's cinema-going public through the mobile cinema campaign in the 1960s, and specifically, the rhetoric of primitivism that dominates the discourse on the campaign. Through close readings of articles and editorials in the revolutionary film journal Cine Cubano, I argue that mobile cinema and its so-called primitive spectators serve as stabilizing figures that help to negotiate the discursive transition that Cuba underwent following the revolution, straddling both "First World" and "Third World" cultural aspirations. My second case study examines one of the iconic short films of the 1960s, For the first time (1967) by Octavio Cortázar. Reading the film as a discursive and historical archive, I argue that the film reveals some of the paradoxes inherent in this ambition: the fact that a revolutionary subject (identified with the state) is in conflict with the modern subject desired by many Cuban intellectuals and filmmakers, a subject constituted by critical reflexivity, distance and irony. My final case study examines the publicness of cinema in the Cuban Special Period through a close reading of Honey for Ochún (2001). I argue that the film offers an aesthetic public space through the filmic mise-en-scene offered to the Cuban spectator. Through these case studies I show how discourses, representations and appeals to the film spectator constitute an important site of public discourse in post-revolutionary articulations of Cuban national identity and revolutionary subjectivity. <em>Latin American history; mass communications; Film studies; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Cuban revolution; Film viewership Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Modernity and its media have capitalized on the ideology and mythology of the cowboy in search of maturation because his struggle parallels the seductive quality of the repetition compulsion to resolve the paradoxes of modern life and gender constructs. American culture has produced the Western, a genre about masculinities, that offers an excellent vantage point from which to examine this male subjectivity. The fight for the orphan myth's antihero exists in proving himself a worthy son to his remote father. The lack of a paternal relationship impacts negatively on the son, who becomes confused over the definition of his own masculine role. This dissertation examines a series of instances in the American Western in which this struggle for masculinity is particularly evident. John Wayne, as the iconic cowboy, is the heroic defender of capitalism, of hegemonic America, of community, and of the orphan. In the book, Horseman, Pass By (1961) and Hud (1963), the film made from that book, the cowboy becomes the antihero, who embodies radical individualism and marketplace greed. Midnight Cowboy (1969) depicts the iconic westerner in terms of marketplace masculinity, traditional masculinity, hyper-masculinity, and homosexual masculinity. In Little Big Man (1970), the protagonist is an unlikely antihero, who maintains a tenuous hold on his sanity and life as he desperately tries to survive frontier masculinities' egocentrism and cruelty that unleashed their power to destroy whatever or whoever came in their path. Unforgiven (1992) presents an avenging antihero, who embodies a primal masculinity that satisfies the viewer's hunger for revenge and judgment upon societal injustice as well as a nurturing masculinity that includes the ability to offer paternal care. In the end, the iconic cowboy or outlaw remains an index to what never existed: a unified, non-paradoxical, construct of traditional masculinity. <em>American studies; Motion pictures; American literature; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Language; literature and linguistics; Arthur Penn; Clint Eastwood; Eastwood; Clint; John Schlesinger; Larry McMurtry; Martin Ritt; Masculinity; McMurtry; Larry; Orphan myth; Penn; Arthur; Ritt; Martin; Schlesinger; John; Western Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

This rare luxury of time in daily news production allowed for a fresh glimpse at the factors that influence coverage. A discourse analysis of three Toronto newspapers was used to explore the media’s role both in constructing myth and in providing a critical forum for discussion of an important figure’s legacy. Specifically, I asked the following questions: What were the main themes of the coverage?&nbsp; How was Pope John Paul’s legacy portrayed? What voices were prominent? Were some legacy issues absent? What were the main narratives used to capture the story? What role did journalistic objectivity play?&nbsp; Were there major differences in the coverage provided by the three papers? Did the pre-planned nature of the news event inflect coverage? I argue that the coverage was limited by journalists’ conceptions of the story, which were rooted in a hero narrative. It was constrained by internal culture and a lack of consideration for the pope’s position of power. The media did provide critical coverage of John Paul’s legacy, but only on narrow questions of internal Church doctrine. They ignored his role as a world political leader on important questions such as the AIDS pandemic in Africa. I argue that they were limited by ideological and cultural constraints rather than by external pressures, even though the coverage attempted to provide critical discussion while it also retold a standard myth. <em>Journalism; mass media </em></p> </td>

The project offers an approach to archivization which ‘gives’ something to a memory by raising more questions than it answers, and allowing the process of ‘smoothing over’ the past to unfold on-screen through the participants themselves rather than through the mode of storytelling. -- from the introduction. <em>&nbsp;Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

The paper is divided into two major sections. Chapter One examines the theories of critical political economy and policy networks and argues that these two approaches offer useful analyses of power that reveal opportunities for progressive interventions. Chapter Two examines the CRTC's 1998 radio review, paying particular attention to the attempts of various actors, representing both economic and noneconomic interests, to influence the CRTC's policy on radio ownership. Using critical political economy and policy networks theory, a detailed and contextualized picture of how power is exercised in the policy process is provided. In conclusion, it is argued that institutionally based policy intervention is an important tool for the left, but not adequate in and of itself, in efforts to defend and foster a rich and diverse public interest media"--From the Introduction page 4. <em>Public broadcasting; policy; Canada; Communication; Economic aspects; Power (Social sciences); Public radio; Canada; Case studies; Right and left (Political science); Canada Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

This dissertation offers a new analysis of Canadian English-language TV drama content’s failure to mature into a popular genre or robust economic sector since its introduction in the 1960s, and suggests ways that the Canadian English-language TV drama value chain might be strategically adjusted in response to global market disruption, by strengthening the development phase. The problem is approached with two methodologies: value chain analysis and qualitative field research. Findings identify weak links in the value chain and propose that the Canadian English-language TV drama content model is structurally flawed and has inhibited maturation of the sector. The study theorizes a TV drama value chain composed of 3 functional segments (develop, produce, distribute) and identifies the root of the Canadian drama problem as the creation phase, known in TV as development, analogous to the R&amp;D phase in other industries. The theorization explains why decades of policy attention and subsidies targeted to the production phase have not substantially improved domestic or global market performance of Canadian English-language TV drama. Moreover, the reframing reveals that development and distribution are functionally linked, while the production phase is the most separate. Theorization and field research concur that a strong imperative for financial returns is essential for successful creative results, from the earliest moments of development. Conversely, a weak link to monetization negatively impacts asset creation, impairing the development phase and, in the case of Canadian English-language TV drama, inhibits its capability to compete effectively in a 21st-century drama attention economy that increasingly rewards creative excellence. Interviews with stakeholders occupying elite development positions in the Canadian and Hollywood TV drama industry confirm an urgency to upgrade development to foster transformation of Canada’s TV drama model, from one purposed for domestic supply to one driven by global demand, and in so doing, future-proof Canadian TV drama for the digital age. Against the backdrop of Canada’s unique geo-cultural position vis a vis the U.S., characterized by brain drain of high-performing Canadian TV drama creators to Hollywood and attempts by Canadian English-language TV drama to compete with Hollywood hits, this research contributes to debates on cluster upgrading, local-global linkages, and economic diasporas that focus on value capture of highly skilled professionals who seek career acceleration in global escalator regions. Findings are applicable to any nation upgrading domestic creative industries which, like TV drama, are characterized by an imperative for innovation excellence in R&amp;D-intensive global value chains. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

I explore these ideas and scales of home in international and multi-medial texts, which include Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves (2000), Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere (television series and novel 1996, graphic novel adaptation 2007), M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village (2004), Nicolas Dickner’s Nikolski (2005, trans. 2008), Lars von Trier’s Dogville (2003), and Wolfgang Becker’s Good Bye, Lenin! (2003). My corpus of texts demonstrates that a traditional understanding of home as a distinct location is incompatible with the realities of liquid modernity, and, moreover, sheds light on new modes of constructing home as a composite of locations and scales—a complex, multi-scalar, geocultural map of identity and belonging. Together, these texts show a dual pattern that makes visible the need to rethink the notion of home: an inclusive map of home on various scales helps home-makers to integrate the various places and people who populate their understanding of home, while the inability to conceive of home in this multifarious way nurtures social fissures, conceptual homelessness, and even psychoses. My main objectives are to challenge neutral, utilitarian conceptions of space, place, and home, and to demonstrate the possibility of what Heidegger calls “poetic dwelling” in liquid modern times and an increasingly inhospitable, market-driven social landscape <em>contemporary cinematic texts; contemporary literature; dwelling; hospitality; identity; Jacques Derrida; liquid modernity; Martin Heidegger; Zygmunt Bauman.

This dimension of reality is articulated in Eastern philosophical notions of pre-reflective thinking and interrelatedness, what Marshall McLuhan called 'comprehensive awareness.' Jean Baudrillard has observed the inability of Western theory to keep up to this 'higher logic' in technologically driven economic globalization. But his lament for the death of theory, leads us to the place where theory lives in the convergence of Eastern and Western philosophical traditions. The projections of McLuhan materialize in the East-West nexus of Miyazaki Hayao's anime. By showing us how we reach an ethical state of communication in the theoretical vacuum left by the relativities of the postmodern, Miyazaki also demonstrates that Walter Benjamin's gamble with cinema is in play. <em>Communication and the arts; Hayao Miyazaki; Japan Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

At the level of the consumer, 'going-green' has become a popular trend aimed at curbing environmental impact by using less and living in more responsible ways. To support this, there are an increasing number of content providers (e.g. web sites) that are combining green lifestyle tips, carbon calculator options, and community forums through interactive platforms. These measures are based on the belief that signing up with these sites and adopting environmentally sustainable behaviours will have positive influences on improving our environment (e.g., lowering green house gases). However, there have not been comprehensive studies to examine this proposition. Research efforts examining the ways in which networked communication and information technologies can foster environmental participation online are nascent, and there remain significant knowledge gaps as to how individual involvement with environmental initiatives can be leveraged by interactive technologies found on the web. This Major Research Paper (MRP) illustrates a case study that aimed to encourage positive environmental outcomes through online support initiatives. It assesses the influence of the Internet as a tool for engaging people in environmental issues of emissions reduction, sustainable lifestyle choices, ecologically-friendly products, and consumer responsibility in the 'going-green' marketplace.

There persists, in particular, an extreme imbalance in the global flow of information, with multinational corporations from the Western nations dominating the production and dissemination of information. The majority of the world's population is still lacking the "basic tools of modem communication, information and knowledge", as a result of the increasingly hierarchical structure of ownership and influence over the emerging communications and information technologies (Mowlana 60).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First tracing historically the NWICO movement itself, the paper will argue for the continuing relevance of the movement not only to our time, but will assert that the NWICO demands speak directly to central issues of Canadian communications. While Canadian officials were not prepared to side with the non-aligned proponents of the NWICO, Canada has clearly struggled with issues closely related to those facing less developed countries (LDCs) in the existing world information and communications order. This paper will consider Canada's position on the movement in the context of its own domestic policies, attempting to shed light on the logic driving the official Canadian response to the movement. Despite the coincidence of interests between Canadian leaders and leaders of the nations promoting the NWICO, our policy stance historically has been aligned with the Western world, blocking any real transformation of the New World Order. As a result of the opposition of capitalist liberal-democracies, it would appear that the highly politicized movement of the non-aligned countries has been abandoned. Yet the issues raised by the NWICO continually re-appear, fragmented and de-politicized, in various forums including debates over the inclusion of the cultural sector in free trade.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Explored most intensively here will be the ways in which Canadian official development assistance (ODA) in the field of communications may be seen as a Canadian response to the demands for a NWICO. While Canada's policy stance in the debate within UNESCO may have been relatively straightforward, the ideologies underpinning development initiatives must be teased out. The paper will look both at the intent and the impact of Canadian ODA in order to assess the extent to which these initiatives have met any of the demands put forth by the NWICO, or whether ODA has simply exported Western capitalist models.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It will be argued here that while historically, Canadian communications policy suggests a similarity between the concerns of the Canadian state and those expressed by the proponents of a NWICO, ODA efforts reveal an unwillingness to support any radical re-ordering of world communications promoted by the non-aligned nations. Canada's alignment with opponents of the NWICO, and its ODA in the sphere of information and communications, have both been driven by a concern with maintaining a competitive position in the world economy. In effect, our ODA efforts have defended the very globalizing commercial world system identified by the NWICO as perpetuating inequalities in information and communications. <em>Communication; International cooperation; Economic assistance; Canadian; Canada; Foreign relations; New World Information and Communications Order; Canadian Official Development Assistance Program; International economic relations </em></p> </td>

Through this analysis I focus specifically on three distinct spheres; performance, fandom and use of technology to argue that her critique of sexual conventions provides an cxpansive and transgressive new definition of female sexuality. Musical performances by female artists, particularly icons such as Madonna and Britney Spears, have demonstrated popular culture's inability to legitimize queer and non-compulsory heterosexual practices. These performances often function as limiting representations of the sexual female. Queerness in popular music culture is often showcased as</p> <p>non-traditional and used as a form of spectacle. The appropriation of homoerotic imagery has traditionally served the purpose of appeasing the mass patriarchal pornographic gaze. I argue that Peaches embodies the essential queer spirit, presenting a politics that builds upon a more fluid sexuality. She reconfigures queer and heterosexual imagery using the language and framework that has been provided by compulsory heterosexuality, to shatter the foundation so often used against women and thereby presenting a new female erotic. <em>Canada; Canadian music; Canadian Electro-Pop; gender and sexual politics; performance; popular culture; popular music; queerness; spectacle.

While the anniversary meant celebration to many, it also encouraged a moment to pause, a moment to meditate and reflect on the past century –and the centuries of history before Confederation. The Canadian Centennial was a moment to look back and ask who we were then, who we are now, and who we will become in the future. The National Film Board of Canada, long used by Canadian artists to explore those same questions, conceived of a project in this year, the Challenge for Change (CFC), to pose these questions in a new fashion. The CFC ran across Canada from 1967 to 1980. An activist documentary project, the CFC attempted to address poverty and provoke social change in disadvantaged sections of the Canadian population.1 The CFC utilized participatory filmmaking techniques to help promote constructive discussion in these disadvantaged communities. In this activist vein, the CFC produced over 200 films exploring Canada from the East Coast to the West, featuring French Canadians, rural Canadians, urban Canadians, and Indigenous populations. Now, in 2017, we have reached Canada’s Sesquicentennial and find ourselves much in the same position as we did at Canada’s Centennial. Looking back at the past 150 years, the same questions are posed – who were we then, who are we now, and who will we become? I believe that with an updated CFC model, one that has minimized the weaknesses and reinforced the strengths of the original project, improved the participatory process through Participatory Action Research methods, and developed a new strategy of media outreach, a new CFC project is better able to investigate those questions. My vision of the CFC project is more adaptable and self-aware than its predecessor, and thus able to be applied more equitably across Canada. This re-imagined Challenge for Change project is equipped with an improved methodology to better explore the needs of Canadians and develop solutions to poverty through the investigative power of documentary filmmaking.

I highlight the differential value placed on corporate, "scientific," and local-ecological knowledges and articulations of GE in the ongoing struggle over biotechnology's knowledge-power structures. This struggle is taking place across scientific and legal institutions and daily lives, though the bulk of this study's analytic focus is on two highly visible (internationally followed) court cases: [1998] Monsanto v. Schmeiser and [2002] Hoffman et al. v. Monsanto . Other studies of these cases treat the law straightforwardly, as an arena in which to challenge intellectual property rights over seeds (c.f. de Beer 2007; Garforth and Ainslie 2006; Muller 2006). I draw inspiration from science and technology studies and treat the law as a mediating institution between biotechnology and publics that through its discursive processes gives shape to biotechnological culture. In this view, legal discourse reinforces particular "scientific" claims through the articulation of what counts as valid "science" in controversial legal disputes. Using ethnography and critical discourse analysis I set activist articulations of science and biotechnology against legal ones. Western Canadian farmers describe GE tome in a wide range of social and cultural implications in which I trace a history of environmental political ideas stretching back to the late 20th century's public reception of Silent Spring. Activist risk discourses find no epistemic space in the current scientistic regulatory regime, and farmers are using legal activism in order to open up biotechnological governance—specifically the politics of regulatory science—to broader participation and scrutiny.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, my analysis shows that the courts reaffirm the scientistic assumption, one constructed in the routines of governance culture, that biotechnology is a technical risk issue. The courts exclude alternative ways of communicating about harms to humans and the environment and limit the social import of biotechnologies. This case study therefore suggests something of broad relevance: that courts may be an unsuitable venue for integrating local knowledges and ecological risk assessments into authoritative biotechnological discourses. <em>Cultural anthropology; Food Science; Sociology </em></p> </td>

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> This dissertation chronicles the formation of a Canadian avant-garde cinema and its relation to the tradition of art of purposeful difficulty. It is informed by the writings of George Steiner, who advanced a typology of difficult forms in poetry. The major works of Jack Chambers (The Hart of London), Michael Snow (La Region Centrale), and Joyce Wieland (Reason Over Passion) illustrate the ways in which a poetic vanguard in cinema is anchored in an aesthetic of difficulty. Such aesthetics enclose the various forms of avant-garde cinema, from the lyrical to the structural film, and signal work of an enduring radicalism. SImultaneously, this dissertation charts the origins of these artists, the circumstances that formed their aesthetic themes, and their maturation. In doing so, it attends to their individual origins and sources, and consequently, the individuation of their artistic activity. This research fills gaps in the literature of Canadian cinema by explicitly linking the origins of a Canadian avant-garde cinema to the forms of purposeful difficulty in modernism. Additionally, it offers new commentary on the idea of difficulty in art, and specifically, the resonances of difficult modern art in vanguard cinema. This study champions progressive poetic form in avant-garde cinema, identifying aesthetic strategies that have analogues in other art forms such as music, painting and poetry. <em>Experimental films; Canada; History and criticism; Experimental films; Canada; Chambers; John; 1931-; Snow; Michael; 1929-; Wieland; Joyce; 1931-1998 </em></p> </td>

How these attacks made against the conservative parties during this timeframe were interpreted by mothers of adolescent children receives particular considerations. The findings demonstrate that during this period the Canadian debate between individualism and communitarianism was prevalent in these political advertisements. It is argued that propaganda methods, namely the name calling technique, were used effectively by the left-wing parties to emphasize specific ideological traditions in conservatism and to link the conservative parties to the United States of America for strategic purposes. The author contends that political advertisements are complex expressions of a party's ideology and goals, thus this campaign tool ought to be studied more by Canadian academics. <em>Television in politics; Canada; Negativism; Advertising; Political </em></p> </td>

Specifically, 1992 shared two significant moments for the female serial killer and her cinematic representation: Aileen Wuornos was convicted for five murders, all carrying a death sentence, and was mistakenly called America's first female serial killer; and the March release of one of the best known female serial killer films---Basic Instinct (Paul Verhoeven). The extreme difference between the two female serial killers is representative of the difference between real and film female serial killers. This thesis explores the differences between real and film female serial killers and between male and female serial killers. The research includes over thirty films that span from 1944 to 2005. In addition to attention on the female serial killer, the final section of the thesis examines the role of the female profiler and how she functions within the narratives of the films. <em>Womens studies; Motion pictures Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Project-Paper:</strong> In this paper, I seek to develop an analysis of an aesthetic framework in which my filmmaking practice is situated, through Marshall McLuhan's ideas concerning acoustic space and their resonances within the avant-garde cinema. This may sound at first to be an inherently contradictory formula, given that a visually predominant medium such as the cinema may not be considered to impart experiences beyond this realm, with the exception of its acoustic components. (Sound cinema, similarly, is generally assumed to evoke sense impressions that exist merely in support of the fidelity of its 'realistic' image). However, I seek to demonstrate how the visualization of acoustic space forms a centrally unifying aesthetic strategy within the Canadian avant-garde cinema and many of the perceptual investigations conducted by film artists working during the time of Mcluhan's writings, resulting in a tradition of works which aim to translate visual experience beyond a fragmentary, visually-abstracted field, thus embodying aspects of kinesthetic vision and tactile/acoustic spatial experience. begin by examining the reception of Mcluhan's scholarship from within communication studies, suggesting the most fruitful reading of his often controversial figure as an artist-mystic rather than strictly as a theorist. I will then examine the varied influences from literary and cultural traditions that shaped his unique approach to media analysis and the development of his model of acoustic space-which Richard Cavell proposes as the primary feature that "connects a multiplicity of elements in Mcluhan's large and diverse oeuvre" (2003: xiii)-and consider the relationship of the cinema to Mcluhan's project of a history of the human sensorium. <em>anti-environmental aesthetic; avant-garde cinema; filmmaking; kinesthetic vision; mainstream media ecology; narrative cinema; Marshall McLuhan; momento mori; momentomorifilm.com; sensory existence; visualization of acoustic space.

In Toronto, the iconic R.C. Harris Filtration Plant (1941) stands as an emblem of modernity and the marvels of hydraulic engineering that assured every citizen of the social right to clean water. We no longer celebrate the material networks of water supply such as R.C. Harris and his public works department fought to achieve; filtered H20 has become another commodity with no reference to the production process. In this thesis I explore the local, historical specifics of water issues embedded in this site and suggest ways that they might contribute to the renewed visibility of hydraulic infrastructure; a re-imagined materiality that might in turn inspire a more sustainable, collective water citizenship. <em>citizenship; neoliberal policy; political economy of water; Toronto; water commodification; water issues; water rights; water supply.

One of the key arguments grounding this dissertation is that the entanglement of computer viruses with the historical tradition on infectious diseases, the technologies used to analyze and map them and the communities they affect and by which they are affected makes their study as separate objects or as products of a single instance of culture (e.g. the products of Information technologies or life sciences) unfeasible. Affinities between computer and biological viruses have been detected by drawing connections between a variety of contexts (i.e. professional and academic ambits, and popular culture) and the intertwining of different disciplinary realms (i.e. life-scientists borrowing methods from computer analysts and vice-versa), locking all viral instances together in a individual viral discourse, which emphasizes issues of threat and security. However, if viruses are only able to cause apprehension and negative reactions, why has the epithet "viral" been promptly applied to not-so-negative phenomena known as "viral videos," "viral marketing" and "viral tactics"? Why and how, with the dissemination of computer viruses (and worms), and infectious (or viral) diseases, have these phenomena that do not necessarily have much in common but which do carry the attribute "viral" emerged? Little has been done to find other ways to assess the above intersections and combinations. I argue that they might be interpreted as the product of what I call the "creative" potential of viruses, which unfolds through the very tensions and contradictions that emerge from their study, dissemination, and manifestation. It is thanks to these very tensions that more creative attempts ensue to understand the structure of viral agents and to creatively appropriate their qualities. By focusing on the technologies used to map and visualize viruses, on scientists and computer experts' conceptions of viruses, as well as on their interpretations and re-elaborations by the creative industries, I plan to shed light on the major role these tensions play in the diffusion and the transformations of viruses. <em>Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Computer viruses; Cultural discourse; Cultural anthropology; Web Studies Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Douglas Kellner observes that "a media culture has emerged in which images, sounds, and spectacles help produce the fabric of everyday life, dominating leisure time, shaping political views and social behavior, and providing the materials out of which people forge their very identities" (Media Culture, 1). The introduction of visual media such as television and personal computers, as well as the popularization of the internet over the last two decades, has brought about major shifts in our conception of the public sphere. Most notable is the transformation, outlined by Jurgen Habermas, from the bourgeois public sphere to a public sphere marked and shaped by mass media and spectacle. Ideally, Habermas' bourgeois public sphere is structured as a social space in which private citizens may assemble to discuss, debate, and come to consensus in order to mediate between the state and civil society. According to Habermas, however, this ideal has been brought to its demise largely because of the influence of the mass media. Habermas' ideal public sphere rests on notions of consensus brought about by rational debate which has been replaced by consumption and uncritical reception. He concludes that the "world fashioned by the mass media is a public sphere in appearance only" (Structural Transformation 171).&nbsp;<em>activism; AIDS/HIV; AIDS activism; AIDS crisis; audience; internet; mass media; newspapers; public and private; public bodies; public sphere; screen media; spectacle; television; visual media.

Indeed, academic and critical considerations of one's own Hip Hop-based musical production is a novel venture; this project, as a fusion of theory with practice, has thus been undertaken so as to occupy that gap. The paper's specific concern is with how (independent) Hip Hop recording artists work to construct their own selves and identity (as formed primarily through lyrical content); the aim here is to explore Hip Hop music and the construction of artistic self· presentation. I therefore went about the task of creating my own album - my own Hip Hop themed musical product - in order to place myself in the unique position to examine it critically as cultural artifact, as well as to write commentary and (self-)analyses concerning various aspects of (my) identity formation. The ensuing outlined tripartite theoretical framework is to serve as a model through which other rappers/academics may think about, discuss, and analyze their own musical output, their own identities, their own selves. <em>Rap (Music); History and criticism; Self-presentation; Rap musicians </em></p> </td>

It does so by conducting narrative analysis and framing analysis of newspaper coverage of the ceremonial Opening of the Legislature. In contrast to standard political science approaches to this key civic ritual, the dissertation builds upon cultural theory that views news as central to the social construction of reality and addresses three research questions: In what ways has the meaning of the legislative opening been represented in mainstream Ontario newspapers? How have mass mediated processes of ritualization changed over time? And what do answers to the first two questions suggest about the development of popular conceptions of political legitimacy in Ontario? Textual analysis demonstrates that social knowledge about the legislative opening has changed significantly between 1900 and 2007. During the first half of the twentieth century, journalists approached and described the Opening of the Legislature as a Social Celebration: a popular festival at Queen's Park that was also a break from routine policy discourse and partisan battle. By contrast, by the 1970s coverage was organized around the Speech from the Throne. Increasingly aggressive journalistic tones and techniques represented the ritual as a performance of rationality--a special iteration of Politics as Usual. Once a celebration of social order centred around Ontario High Society, the legislative opening is now depicted as a debate among competing interests in Ontario society. While remaining critical of the emergent ritual of liberal-pluralism for its part in normalizing systems of inequality, the dissertation argues that changes in newspaper coverage both reflect and reinforce the rise of what Smith calls "electoral democracy", a conception of politics in which extra-parliamentary actors are legitimized as participants in government. At the level of scholarly practice, the study makes an original contribution to recent debates in media anthropology by using longitudinal textual analysis to study the ritualization of civic ritual; and shifts in news coverage are used to advocate further interdisciplinary studies of legislative politics in Canada. <em>Legislative bodies; Press coverage; Ontario; Press and politics; Discourse analysis; Narrative </em></p> </td>

Asking what Hollywood's male dancers communicate about masculinity, this study provides detailed readings of fourteen popular choreographies for men and finds that there are three physical codes Hollywood's male dancers utilize to dance white masculinity. The first code requires the male dancer's gestures stay within their personal kinesphere; the second code expects men's torsos to appear stable and strong; the third code has men emphasize gravity's pull on their body's weight and danced activities. As this dissertation discovers, these three physical codes combine to create recognizable and understandable gendered codes for dancing masculinity in North America and allow Hollywood's male stars to participate in what is generally understood as a female activity (dancing). Also, the three physical codes metaphorically maintain the male dancer's identity as patriarchs and do so by maintaining the illusion that male privileges are the inevitable outcome of the differences between men and women: differences that this dissertation maintains are socially and culturally constructed illusions. An important outcome of this research was discovering that white male dancers dance masculinity and simultaneously promote and maintain the relationships and images of ‘white’ as the dominate and ‘ordinary’ racial condition of living the American Dream. What is surprising is that Hollywood's white male dancers maintain the images of white privilege and domination while borrowing heavily from the movement vocabulary and aesthetics of African American social and theatrical dance. To explore the complex relationship between white masculinity and African American dance vernacular this dissertation provides a short history of ‘blackface’ dance in order to understand the netlike web of African American traces that infuse Hollywood's white danced masculinity from turn of the century Vaudeville to the recent Hollywood hit Napoleon Dynamite.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many of the observations this dissertation discovered are summed up in the concluding pages that suggest our gendered and racial commonalities are ultimately more important than the physical codes Hollywood male dancers' perform in order to construct white danced masculine identities. <em>Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Choreography; Hollywood; Masculinity; Movement vocabulary; Whiteness; Dance; Gender studies; Film studies Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Within the ideals of journalism are notions that emotional narratives and affective discourses are secondary, or even degrading, to serious news stories. Other journalistic ideals view emotions as a kind of necessary evil to the selling of news. Lastly, in scholarship around the democratic potential of human</p> <p>interest or soft news stories (typically narrated using emotive language), there is an idea that soft news stories are only meaningful in so far as they act as a gateway to serious news issues. These theories of serious news degrade the role that the affects play in news texts. This paper suggests that emotions and the deployment of affective discourse in news texts can be understood as meaningful beyond their work in selling news stories or acting as a gateway to serious issues. This paper is interested in the ascension of "serious" news, and the way in which emotion in the news became regarded as trivial and unimportant. More specifically, I examine the division between serious, factual, objective news and dramatic, emotional human-interest stories, and their associated classificatory terms "hard" and "soft" news. This paper attempts to problematize the characterization of serious news as non-emotional, and non-serious news as emotional, by demonstrating how the press's commitment to the public sphere is an affective commitment predicated on the idea of "care." As this paper argues, the press's commitment to the public sphere, though, is vague and ambiguous. The effect of ambiguity around concepts of the public sphere and regarding ideas of care is that the press envisions care in differing ways. The differential alignment of the press with humanitarian goals, thus, works to privilege certain sites and methods of care over others. In this way, news coverage reflects a politics of care that operates through the alignment of public sympathies with pre-existing authorities of aid, relief and assistance. In order to demonstrate the affective work of the press, this paper examines news coverage of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. <em>affect theory; Haiti; human-interest stories; global audience; journalism; natural disaster; news media; news organizations; objectivity; politics of care; public sphere; world events.

What these statistics do not capture, however, is a diversification of game design, an expansion of videogame production into new audiences and, accordingly, new expressive territories. This paper examines a relatively new current in game design: the pseudo-genre known informally as the ‘walking simulator’. This term, often used derisively, refers to games where the play centers on characters walking in a simulated environment; that is, videogames where the protagonist does little besides explore a space. Its derisive uses issue from a perception that such games are purposeless and thus boring, as the player is not able to intervene meaningfully in the narrative situation. Indeed, certain critics are quick to deny walking simulators’ status as games. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Organizations mission and purpose are translated into the spatial design of workplaces. In the most dominant sectors such as finance and banking neoliberal organizations operate around the space of flows, generated by globalization, technology and postmodernity (Castells, 2000). The space of flows is also manifest in the spatial design of the workplace shaping employees’ working identities and behaviours. The dissertation asserts that there are two classes of office workers evolving in the workplace: the professional knowledge workers who are increasingly mobile and autonomous; and the routine clerical workers who are captive in a hegemonic system that keeps them doing clerical work with little prospect of promotion. It is significant that the clerical class is composed mostly of women. Personalia and Women’s Spatial Practices In The Routine Office examines the head offices of Investors Group in Winnipeg, Canada, in terms of how the company’s offices both reflect and generate spaces of flows. Women’s participation rates have grown from being a small minority in the 1900s to approximately 70% of the clerical workforce in the 2000s. Through microanalysis of previously unexamined personalia, or personal objects at the desk, the dissertation finds work spaces are expressive of women’s lived experiences of work. By conducting interviews and photographic studies of the workspaces of 11 women at Investors Group the research uncovers the ways women use the personalia at their desks to reappropriate the everyday spaces of the office. The identification of the term personalia becomes a key concept in the work and a contribution to the study of the close environment of the office desk. Social networks with co-workers, past and present are honored in the personalia at the desk; and tactics such as repurposing office supplies as gifts, along with numerous individual and heterogeneous behaviours demonstrate that routine work spaces are not neutral spaces, but are open to the expressive practices which de Certeau calls operations. The ways that women make space for themselves and push against the hegemony of the neoliberal organization are specific and instructive. They reflect women’s values and the identities crafted for public and private consumption. The research closely examines the practices of women in the financial services industry through the filter of Lefebvre’s trialectic for the analysis of space (1991), de Certeau’s ways of operating and tactics (1998), and Franck’s interpretation of Women’s Ways of Knowing (1989; 2000). The research demonstrates how personalia in the contemporary workplace reflects women’s values, and how women’s values have influenced the design of the workplace. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Electronic dance music and its digital modes of production, performance and consumption within this paradigm require alternative ways of thinking about originality, creativity, and authenticity. While I do look briefly at issues of consumption and performance within dance music cultures, I focus specifically on how electronic music producers are bound by a unique vision of musical authenticity and creativity, borne out of their "technological imagination" and the sonic possibilities enabled by digital technology. To use the concepts employed within my paper, I contend that dance music cultures make evident what Michael Punt calls the "postdigital analogue"--a cultural condition in which the decidedly more "human" or "analogue" elements of felt experience and authenticity coexist and converse with the predominance of the digital technologies of simulation and artifice. Dance music cultures are an emergent social formation, to use Williams' term, revising and questioning the typical relationships understood between digital and analogue. This postdigital analogue manifests in a number of ways in the cultural, aesthetic, and technological principles promoted by dance music cultures. In terms of production in particular, signs of digital and analogue coexist in a form of virtual authenticity, as the sound of the technological process engaged to make electronic dance music bears the mark of musical creativity and originality. This study reveals the unique manner in which dance music cultures incorporate both analogue and digital principles, bridging a sense of humanity with the acceptance of the technological. <em>Electronic music; Underground dance music; Rave culture; Virtual reality; Cultural anthropology; Music </em></p> </td>

The thesis uses an ethnographic, case study approach and interviewed volunteers of one CWN group, Wireless Toronto. Findings showed that volunteers are part of a demographic suggestive of an emerging "creative civic core". In addition, it found diverse notions of community were central parts of volunteers' discourse, especially when attempting to understand their overall rationale for provisioning free (public) wi-fi. A conceptual framework including social capital, community networks, community informatics, and visions of technology is used throughout. In all, the thesis argues that these urban CWNs are hybrid social and civic networks whose immediate social impact is practical (i.e. local community participation) and long-term impact, symbolic-ideological (social constructions of technology and community). <em>Social structure; Mass media; Communication and the arts; Social sciences Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

For this project, ReMaking KM6, I returned to my childhood home of Santa Cruz, Bolivia creating representations of this city in the context of Latin America. Through the lens of hybridity, I look at my own process of autoethnography and documentary photography. The concept of hybridity resonates in my personal narrative, which illustrates the meeting between Korean, Bolivian and Canadian cultures. As a result, the visual evidence gathered demonstrates a specific perspective and contributes to the pool of Latin American images available in North America. The photographs gathered during my fieldwork illustrate the day-to-day lives of Crucenos (people of Santa Cruz) that disrupt notions of Latin America as static, and exotic providing an alternative to stereotypes of this region. In order to illustrate specific examples of this process, this essay will refer to the seventy-page book titled ReMaking KM6: Childhood Memories of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, that outlines this journey through the combination of visual evidence and narratives. <em>Canada; cultural identity; documentary photography; hybridity; hybrid identity; Latin America; memory; Santa Cruz; self-representation; subjectivity.

Employing gender theory and political economy, this research interrogates the feasibility of creating a reliable assessment of gender in film, and explores multiple uses for such an assessment. It involves interviews with film professionals on the impact that a reliable gender assessment could have on their work and the industry, and an examination of representation research models focused on gender. The research proposes and tests an assessment of misogyny in film. It makes a preliminary contribution to the creation of a simple assessment for misogyny in mainstream movies as one step to challenge stereotyped representations of gender in media.

The paper begins with a discussion of the cosmogonic notions of Chaos and nothing that Bey adopts in his work and explores the ways in which these notions are foundational to his concept of Ontological Anarchy. It is then explained how, through indiscriminately drawing on a variety of mystical and magical traditions (from those of Pagan Greece and Ancient India to the contemporary Western Occult world) Immediatism aims to establish an experiential foundation for the reality of interdependent non-dual wholeness. In order to advance Bey’s critique of ‘the sleep of Order’, pathological (calculative) reason, and Western technological development, his work is brought into dialogue with that of schizoanalyst and philosopher Felix Guattari. The final part of this paper discusses the implications of Bey’s Immediatist project for contemporary artistic practice, with special emphasis placed on musical forms and the possibility of reviving Occidental sacred musical traditions. <em>Hakim Bey, Peter Lamborn Wilson, Felix Guattari, Chaos, Nothing, Ontological Anarchy aestheticism; chaos; identity; immediatism; nothingness; ontological anarchy; musical recordings; unnatural.

Familiarity, social performativity, and material mastery form three crucial, interlocking junctures where skill and mastery are framed as essential components for understanding games. The game controller is positioned as a 'gatekeeper' between player and game; a precluding factor in engaging with the medium. Participant responses from original qualitative research, which places a primacy on female voices, are framed within a gaming climate of historically increasing complexification of game genres and material components, and point to several trends in how women can (and do) contend with gendered technology. <em>Women; Computer games; Video games </em></p> </td>

Words and phrases like weapons of mass destruction, regime change and coalition of the willing were designed to rally a global public consensus behind the war, and extend the goodwill that many western nations offered the U.S. after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This dissertation examines the role of strategic lexicons in the framing of television coverage on Fox News, CNN, ABC and PBS in the United States, and on CBC and CTV in Canada. As Entman's (2004) 'cascading activation' model suggests, although political elites tend to be the originators of foreign policy news frames, they cannot ensure that their frames will be used consistently, sympathetically or coherently. The active role that journalists play in mediating framed messages to their audiences is as important as the messages themselves, and too often overlooked.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This dissertation explores the different ways that six North American broadcasters reacted to the lexical framing of the U.S. administration and the anti-war movement. The image of the war presented by American cable broadcasters was found to be much more faithful to the administration's communication strategy than were any of the other broadcasters, and the Canadian newscasts differed most significantly in that they tended not to cover the Iraq story in the context of terrorism and they tended to show less vitriol to Saddam Hussein and his forces.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The findings in this dissertation are significant because they lead us to rethink the relationship between news management, propaganda and framing. While the administration was somewhat successful in shaping journalistic language during the Iraq invasion, it was not successful in winning over skeptical and dissenting publics in the U.S. or elsewhere. Although the use of framing language may be an effective short-term strategy, it leads to opinion change that is neither durable nor predictive of real political action. More significantly, communication strategies such as this are detrimental to the public sphere because they work to undermine intelligent discourse and marginalize dissent. <em>Communication and the arts; Language; literature and linguistics; Invasion; Iraq; Political linguistics; Regime change; Terrorism; Weapons of mass destruction; Rhetoric; Composition; Mass media Media and Culture;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Yet empirical research demonstrates that freelance media work is becoming increasingly precarious. This dissertation is a case study of the working conditions of Canadian freelance writers, the political economic and cultural context in which they work, and their efforts to organize collectively to address challenges they face. The dissertation examines the underlying processes, practices, and power relations that shape the work of freelance writing to argue that freelancers' experiences flow directly from the capitalist logic of the corporate cultural industries in which they work. In this view, freelance writing has been transformed from being primarily a strategy of resisting salaried labour by journalists—an effort to gain some control over the terms of commodification of their labour power and autonomy over their craft—into a strategy for media firms to intensify exploitation of freelance writers' labour power through two primary strategies: the exploitation of unpaid labour time and control of copyright to writers' works. Drawing on Marxist political economic analysis, a survey of Canadian freelance writers, and interviews with freelance writers' unions and organizations, the dissertation examines how exploitation is obscured in freelance cultural work and how it can be confronted through collective organization. The dissertation examines Canadian freelance writers' current organizing efforts: a professional association, a union, and an agency-union hybrid, arguing that the models freelancers favour tend to reinforce notions of professionalism and a preference for service-based organizations, which has not given freelancers the power required to effectively defend themselves against corporations' changing business practices. The dissertation outlines the challenges writers' organizations need to overcome, not least freelance writers' ambivalence toward their status as workers. Finally, the dissertation foregrounds labour processes as central to understanding media, suggesting that continual downloading of the risks of journalistic labour onto precarious workers will have implications for the future of freelance writing as an occupation and the media content produced. <em>Journalism; Labor economics; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Social sciences Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Massive media are massive in their size and subsequent visibility, but are also an agglomeration of media in their expressive screen and cinema-like qualities and their associated audio, interactive, and network capabilities. This dissertation finds that massive media enable and necessitate the development of new practices of expanded cinema, public data visualization, and new media art and curation that blend the logics of urban space, monumentality, and the public sphere with the aesthetics and affordances of digital information and the moving image to support a more participatory public culture in which we identify and engage with collective presence, memory, and action through information, architecture, and the moving image. Through historical research, case studies, conversations with cultural producers, participant observation, and creation-as-research projects, large-scale public projections are shown to represent a new monumentality that can be better understood and evaluated using analytical tools from cinema studies, namely superimposition, montage, and apparatus/dispositif. Low-resolution LED façades, while sharing some of the functional and theoretical characteristics of projection, are shown to uniquely support an emerging practice of public data visualization and represent a more consistent embodiment of a hybrid and relational public sphere through a tighter coupling of information, architecture, and context. Programmable architectural façades, more than projections, embody the development of supermodernism in architecture where data-rich public spaces of identity, congregation, and contestation seek and find appropriate and consistent outlets in highly visible spatial assemblages of architecture and media. Finally, a curatorial approach to massive media is crucial in order to create suitable spaces and opportunities for the development of massive media as a legitimate art form. This requires the sustained provision of technical support and coordination as well as an ongoing negotiation with corporate, institutional, and civic owners and operators. While massive media exists primarily as a highly commercialized phenomenon, it can also be pressed into service, through coordinated curatorial and artistic efforts, to critique or co-opt commercialization, and to re-envision the role of urban media environments in shaping collective identity, historical consciousness, and public display culture. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Implicit in these representations is the assumption that teenagers often avoid taking on responsibilities for others. However, these representations likely do not reflect the life experiences of many teenagers, in particular immigrant teens, who may take on many responsibilities for their families and for their society. Building on a participatory methodology, this paper explores the experiences of four immigrant teenagers, asking how immigrant youth negotiate mediated popular culture representations of teenage freedom in relation to their responsibilities to others. This paper will argue that immigrant youth negotiate popular mediated representations of individual freedom in relation to their responsibilities as individuals, family members and members of a society. This research contributes to the fields of youth studies and youth culture studies and to the subfield of communication that examines immigrants’ interactions with media systems. First, this paper interrogates two dominant assumptions that are present in cultural representations of the teenager: (1) Being a teenager is a time of freedom, and (2) Teenagers avoid taking on responsibilities for others. This study also contributes to filling a gap in the research on the experiences of immigrant youth in youth culture studies as well as contributes to a small body of research on immigrant youths’ interactions with popular culture. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> This dissertation chronicles an important time in Canadian dance history but also offers a framework to analyze Canadian identity in dance. Cultural policy on dance offers insight into the nature of Canadian identity from 1967 to 1983. This dissertation uses dance as a lens to examine communities within the nation. Five choreographic works from the period are analyzed and represent Canadian western theatrical dance: Rose Latulippe (Macdonald), Baroque Suite (Earle), "The Brick Series" (Adams), Marie Chien Noir (Chouinard) and Joe (Perreault). This dissertation also uses cultural policy as a vehicle to analyze the State from the Centennial of Confederation to the publication of the Applebaum-Hébert Report. Writings by Leslie Armour, R. Bruce Elder, Alan Filewod, Northrop Frye, B.W. Powe, Grant Strate and Pierre Trudeau inform the research. Ultimately, the relationships between individual artists, the dance community and the State illustrate the complex development of Canadian choreography. My research is driven by a desire to first, fill some of the gaps in the literature on Canadian dance, and second, examine dance through cultural policy. This dissertation begins in 1951 with the Massey Report, but primarily focuses on the period from 1967 to 1983 including the "dance boom era." This research is an important contribution to the field because it compares the development of Canadian dance to theatre, literature, visual art, music and film from 1967 to 1983, to place it within a broader context. This dissertation argues that Canadian choreography embodies the dialectic of the traditional and the contemporary, of the Francophone and Anglophone, and of the individual and community. <em>Dance; Canada; History; Choreography; Choreographers; Arts; Canadian; Government policy; Cultural policy.

Drawing on a modified, less utopian, form of critical discourse analysis, which recognizes the sociocultural power of the visual, this thesis interrogates the promotional literature that the A.A. Marks Company, an artificial limb manufacturer, produced between 1888 and 1920. This thesis critically analyzes the techniques used by the company to assert their authority to frame their relationship to their clients. In addition, this analysis interrogates the company's use of the technologies of vision to champion visually imitative prosthesis. The goal of this analysis is to determine how the company deployed the turn towards the imitative, and what was at stake for the producers, and consumers, as well as the wider culture in the use of imitative limbs. <em>Marketing; History; Amputees; United States; Social conditions; Artificial limbs; Visualist Analysis </em></p> </td>

Its main themes are the intersection of race and class in North America's popular and unpopular cultural products, the presence of history in narrative forms, the politics of representation, authenticity, ideology, and eugenics. My objective is to show how depictions of "white trash" have become a form of psychological compensation for structural economic inequality, as well as an ideological justification for this inequality. I explore the affective dimensions of these different products and identify three main affects these artifacts encourage: schadenfreude, empathy, and anxiety. Schadenfreude is usually the affect encouraged by comedic depictions of "white trash," empathy for the situation of poor whites tends to be elicited in less popular cultural artifacts, and anxiety is evoked by portrayals of "white trash" as threats to the social order. I construe "media representations" broadly to include literature, photography, film, television, and journalism, and genre plays a major role in which affect the content encourages. I do detailed analyses of particular artifacts as case studies of how class and race operate in cultural production. A major consideration of this project is how "white trash" have historically been denied access to self-representation in different media, how this has changed, and why literature has been more accessible to this class fraction as a means of self-representation than others (in the United States, at least). Content is the most important focus of the case studies, although audience considerations and production ephemera play a supporting role in some of the chapters. This is an interdisciplinary work through and through. Its methodological modus operandi is mosaic. While discourse analysis is the scaffolding that structures the overall project, I also use semiotic analysis, quantitative content analysis, and new historicism. My rationale for this methodological diversity is that different media require different methods, and also that the strengths of some methods can make up for the weaknesses of others. The theoretical framework I use to build up to the case studies is dialectic, synthesizing aspects of cultural studies and critical theory, and to a lesser extent, the sociological approach of symbolic interactionism. This project is innovative not only for its methodological diversity, but also for its use of the findings of empirical psychology to support the ongoing relevance of the study of ideology. Furthermore, while other authors who work in the field of "white trash studies" have used boundary theory (Wray 2006) and figurative sociology (Hartigan 2005), I cleave to an unabashed Marxist approach, one informed by the aforementioned synthesis of early cultural studies and critical theory. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

This dissertation explores the cultural politics of the modification (or "modding") of digital games by their users in applying a contextual triangulation of cultural studies, political economy and critical information studies to several relevant case examples that identify, analyze and interrogate how user modification of digital games is affecting and being affected by interactions and confrontations between media users, corporate producers, and wider social and political forces. The concept of modding offered here, broadened from existing conceptions by emphasizing not only the structural alteration of game code but also the potential alterations of conceptual influence (via the borrowing and re-expressing of ideas, themes and subject matter from existing sources), is tied to user creativity as expressed in the concept of participatory culture, itself theorized here as animated by play and playful experimentation within spaces of possibility. Framed in this way, modding is positioned not as a recent gaming phenomenon, but one bound to the entire history of video games as technological forms and to a wider socio-cultural history of playing with cultural forms in general. As such, attempts to contain, regulate or commercially exploit user behaviour (by erecting boundaries of play) are challenged by modification's links to play and playful experimentation that appear both cultural and natural, manifesting in what I call counterplay , the oppositional or disruptive practices of some creative users. From the nuanced perspective offered by disciplinary triangulation, modding is rendered as a multi-dimensional cultural practice, bound both to forces of user empowerment offered by socio-technical change and to forces of user exploitation present in existing socio-economic structural realities. Ultimately, what becomes clear is that how modders negotiate this contested terrain works to persistently redefine the role of media users and expected user behaviour in the popular cultural environments they play in, play with and play against. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

One of the ways this impact occurs is through the virtual manifestation of phenomena related to death. Customs related to death - such as funerals and memorials - are being remediated on the internet in ways that are varied and complex. Remediation, a term introduced by Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin, involves the reinvention of previous forms of media using new media technologies. In this way, every form of media is understood to be a new version of a form of media that already existed. Looking at sites of memorialization of all kinds through the framework of remediation illuminates the ways that the manifestation of issues related to death and memorialization on the internet has and will continue to both complicate and enhance the ways these sites are experienced and conceptualized by those that visit them. While traditional physical memorial sites have always existed - and will continue to exist - sites of remembrance that appear on the internet are emerging as a complementary medium of memorialization. <em>cyber studies; death and photography; Facebook; internet; memory; memorial sites; memorialization; social networking sites; user profiles; virtual memorials.

A case study was conducted centring on the Toronto-based collective Broken Social Scene and its label Arts &amp; Crafts, and original interviews were conducted with Stuart Berman, Charles Spearin, Jason Collett, Jeffrey Remedios and Brendan Canning. An analysis of the major labels and a history of the sensibilities of independent artists establish the habitus of an independent artist at the end of the 1990's. The particulars of Toronto's music scene show the organic origins of the band's collectivity to be in process-based composition and performance. Broken Social Scene's political economy and internal dynamics suggest that Arts &amp; Crafts acts as an aegis for the group's membership and processes. Finally, Broken Social Scene's metaphorical self conceptualization reveals the important structuring role the paradoxical affect of love plays for the group. <em>Broken Social Scene; Canada; Canadian music; independent artists; music industry; music label; political economy; popular culture; Toronto.

Both forms of knowing a space have biases that privilege certain aspects of space. While visual representation on a map totalizes space and emphasizes the spatial relationship between objects, aural/physical experience emphasizes the evanescent quality of walking and narrative. This exploration has led to the idea that space is physical but also represented, experienced and recreated constantly through its use. The project has drawn on the work of various locative artists such as Janet Cardiff and Rimini Protokoll to understand the way that story, listening and walking can inform one's perception of space. The work of Michel de Certeau has also been used to understand how one creates space through the subjective negotiation of place. Finally, the creation process ofthe installation, using consumer electronics, open-source software and programming languages has also been used as a way of looking at how space is articulated through this technology and how it mediates the mapper's and walker's perception of map and territory. <em>Space perception; Geographical perception; Installations (Art); Geography; Social aspects; Visual communication </em></p> </td>

Focusing on Western Canada in the late nineteenth century, I analyze the history of photography in relation to landscape and nationalism. This particular historical period is important as the settlement of the West and subsequent nationalist projects were occurring at the same moment as photographs of the West were beginning to be taken. This context allows for a particular evaluation of the linkages between landscape, photography, visuality, colonialism and nation building. Examining the photographs from an aesthetic, psychological, ideological and affective relation with the invader-settler nation, I bring to light the importance of vision and land to a colonial context. Using an interdisciplinary approach allows me to examine the broad context of the photographs and the larger discourses that they form. As well, I textually analyze each of the six photographs in my corpus. The photographic landscapes which I chose as my corpus form a discourse of Canadian nationalism which is overly determined by the concept of wilderness and the subsequent denial of colonialism. <em>Communication and the arts; Fine arts Media and Culture;Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

More than merely reflecting social, economic and political realities, the pervasive and viral nature of fashion can actually change the cultural realities by challenging the values embedded in certain trends. This is especially true during periods of heightened social upheaval, such as the early twentieth century and the interwar years, when sartorial and social change were promoted by cultural trendsetters such as modernist salonnieres. This Major Research Paper explores the ways in which fashion accrued symbolic meaning in the interwar years as the result of being harnessed by modernist salonnieres such as Natalie Barney, Gertrude Stein and A’Lelia Walker as a vehicle for social change. I do so by drawing on fashion and salon theory and in doing so contribute to discussions in Fashion Studies, as well as Modernism and Gender Studies. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

This paper contends that works of ethnographic journalism such as Alex Kotlowitz's There are no Children Here, David Simon and Ed Bums's The Corner, and Leon Dash's Rosa Lee are critical texts for gaining an informed understanding of the urban crisis because they allow one to make connections with both the empirically observable facts and the shared social experience of the black underclass. By revealing the importance of viewing positivist and interpretivist understandings of the American city as complementary rather than oppositional, these works provide a multifaceted, rather than mutually exclusive, framework for understanding the American urban crisis. This approach allows us to avoid the ontological shortcomings present in traditional methodologies for examining urban poverty-shortcomings that take root in discursive tensions regarding the nature of prejudice in municipal development. Ethnographic journalism evokes the empathy necessary to view urban squalor as a practical concern rather than a spectacle. <em>African American culture; critical realism; epistemic reflexivity; journalism; popular culture; urban crisis.

In a return to the earlier years of queer users participating on the Internet, Tumblr has become a site for exploring identities through the graphics interchange format, or “GIF.” Drawing from GIFs gathered and circulated on the Tumblr page lgbtgifs.tumblr.com, this major research paper discusses the affective potential GIFs produce through the content, structure, and emotions they share. This paper looks at the history of the GIF file format, earlier uses in popular culture, and its transformation into a means of sharing queer representations in the media. It highlights the format’s potential to produce affect through Sara Ahmed’s The Cultural Politics of Emotion (2004).

Queer and feminist scholars suggest that subversive gender performance techniques such as camp can destabilize compulsory heteronormativity and binary gender constructions. Through the study of sketch comics Thompson, Mercer and Smith, it is evident that a range of masculine performances, both implicitly and explicitly in support of queer politics, are supported within popular comedy and Canadian maninstream media. The diverse comic techniques used by these actors prove effective in critiquing aspects of patriarchy, masculinity and heteronormativity as well as questioning essentialist assumptions behind social notions of hierarchy and marginality. <em>Comedians; Canada; Masculinity; Male homosexuality; Gender identity; Political satire; Canadian; Parody.

However, this pathway towards the modernization of the Web has not been entirely linear, nor will it proceed as such. Accordingly, this paper problematizes the notion of "progress" as it relates to the online realm by illuminating two distinct perspectives on the realized and proposed evolution of the Web, both of which can be grounded in the broader debate concerning technological determinism versus the social construction of technology: on the one hand, the centralized and ontology-driven shift from a human-centred "Web of Documents" to a machine-understandable "Web of Data" or "Semantic Web", which is supported by the Web's inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, and the organization he heads, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); on the other, the decentralized and folksonomy-driven mechanisms through which individuals and collectives exert control over the online environment (e.g. through the social networking applications that have come to characterize the contemporary period of "Web 2.0"). Methodologically, the above is accomplished through a sustained exploration of theory derived from communication and cultural studies, which discursively weaves these two viewpoints together with a technical history of recent W3C projects. As a case study, it is asserted that the forward slashes contained in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) were a social construct that was eventually rendered extraneous by the end-user community. By focusing On the context of the technology itself, it is anticipated that this paper will contribute to the broader debate concerning the future of the Web and its need to move beyond a determinant "modernization paradigm" or over-arching ontology, as well as advance the potential connections that can be cultivated with cognate disciplines. <em>communication and cultural studies; end-user communities; internet; online environments; ontology; Semantic Web; technology; social constructions of technology; web studies.

This time period was selected for convenience—the tweets were collected in real time. This period also coincided with the resumption of the House of Commons session, the last one before the election scheduled for the October 19th 2015. The first stage of analysis measured the presence or absence of indicators that corresponded to five categories: informing, connecting, involving, mobilizing and personalizing. This initial stage of analysis determined the tweets’ basic identifying features (informing), use of interactive logics (connecting), employment of outreach (mobilizing) and traditional campaign tactics (involving), and incorporation of popular culture (personalizing). In the second stage of analysis, the findings were further refined and subcategorized to reflect the distinct traits and themes inherent within each account. This stage sought to uncover greater nuance in use between the accounts. A combined total of 5482 leader tweets were coded and analyzed: 135 for Harper, 180 for Mulcair, and 223 for Trudeau. Overall, the findings build on the verdict of Small (2014) and conclude that the leaders’ tweets are used to propel advantageous ideas rather than act as a medium for dialogue. Predominantly managed as forums of political promotion, the accounts: affirm and project established political brands, support party policies, and deflect/ anticipate negative portrayals of each respective leader. More strategic than social, the accounts ultimately serve as campaign vehicles.

Breaking from the narrative storytelling that dominated nineteenth-century vaudeville and ballet, these dancers advanced non-narrative movement, thereby encouraging a new aesthetic engagement from the audience, namely, one that was rooted in notions of corporeal sensation rather than narrative telos or (melo)dramatic pathos. These new responses, this dissertation argues, are reflected in the new tactics for writing the dancing body, which at once render problematic the putative objectivity of journalistic criticism and reveal the limits of traditional dance criticism’s focus on intricate technique and plot line. This dissertation pursues its argument by studying over 300 print reviews of dances performed by Fuller, Duncan, and Allan between 1890 and 1920 culled from North-American archives and representing a spectrum of print media—from mainstream national media, such as The New York Times, to regional newspapers, to more specialized theatre magazines—to reveal compelling insight into hermeneutic entanglements of language and movement. Informed by the work of recent performance studies (e.g. Phelan; Schneider; Taylor), this</p> <p>dissertation approaches this body of dance reviews from an inverse perspective from that represented by traditional dance history scholarship. That is, instead of reading reviews as documentation in order to understand these dances, the study explores how reviewers perform criticism, thus framing our understanding of modern dance in specific ways. <em>Modern dance; Dance; Reviews; Dance criticism; Dance critics; Dance; Philosophy Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

As Kovach expresses this point "the role of the press since its beginning has been to help the people overcome the scarcity of information upon which they could make thoughtful and informed decisions" (Kovach http://www.concernedjournalists.orglnode/492). The higher the standard of journalism, therefore, the more effectively it can fulfill its role. However, questions arise of precisely what is meant by standards of excellence in journalism and furthermore, what are the criteria by which it can be measured? As an area of research, criteria for journalistic excellence remain difficult to define and challenging to measure and quantify. Since industry awards programs devoted to recognizing the best in journalism would reasonably be expected to stipulate their understanding of excellence, they would appear a logical place to begin the task of investigating what constitutes journalistic excellence. Shapiro et al., however, have reported that "many [awards] programs simply don't have judging guidelines, while others consist mostly of lists of terms, without explanation or illustration".</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Without evidence of excellence criteria being available from those industry programs and institutions whose professional role it is to recognize excellence, scholars have had to broach the subject in different ways. Some studies devoted to the goal of naming concrete characteristics of excellence have sought to define "excellence" by interviewing judges, journalists and newspaper editors. These have resulted in individually subjective answers. Other research initiatives have measured journalistic writing by equating quality with conformity to traditional journalistic standards such as "accuracy" and "impartiality" (Bogart 45). Like the subjective opinion of industry professionals, any list of standards in journalism is potentially elusive because of the manifold variables that influence conclusive final judgment. For some industry professionals though. These references to the more enduring standards of the profession "would be seen ... not as criteria of excellence ... but as bare minimum requirements" (Shapiro et al. 6). Shapiro et al. advanced the understanding of "excellence" by reinforcing the presence of these traditional journalistic standards, and by demonstrating that the weighting each judge placed on these criteria was subject to individual preference. While the weighting of criteria of excellence may be subjective, this study's findings indicate that there are indeed commonalities among award winning articles, and these relate to two main variables: theme and structure. <em>Journalism; Canada; History; Journalism; Awards; Canada; Excellence; Journalism; Objectivity </em></p> </td>

In the past twenty-years, it has garnered increasing attention from a growing number of academics across a range of disciplines and from an ever-growing number of stake-holders in society. Several interrelated factors have contributed to this spark in interest in IP. The rise of digital technologies and the internet through the 1990's created a "networked society" (Castells 1996) that has brought greater attention to the exchange and control of knowledge and culture in a range of human activities. 1 The push towards global neoliberalism, reflected in the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its control of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), has resulted in a phenomenon that Toby Miller (1996) dubbed the "new international division of cultural labour" (NICL), which is marked by the shift towards the production of intangible or informational goods as a key driver of industrialized economies. Also, the increasing overlap between culture and the economy in postmodern society, in what Frederic Jameson calls "the cultural turn" (1998) focused attention on the commodification and consumption of culture in everyday life. <em>access; cultural diversity; cultural labour; capitalism; cultural policy; digital economy; education; global labour; intellectual property; intellectual property rights; internet; neoliberalism; political economy; public policy; social policy.

Although films are constructions that aim to reflect or depict reality, they often provide flattened characterizations of fat people, particularly fat women. Because no artistic production can escape the culture within which it is made, Hollywood movies, as well as independently funded and distributed "art house" films, often embed popular stereotypes or misconceptions in the characterization of marginalized people, including the obese. There are many ways to "represent" fatness in film: through the script, cinematography, plot, and the whether it uses a real fat body or a rubber suit. This paper will investigate how one might negotiate representations of obesity in a society that perceives fat as a social evil and fat individuals as "agents of abhorrence and disgust" <em>Body image in women; Body image in motion pictures; Motion pictures and women; Obesity; Social aspects; Motion pictures; Influence Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Culture, though often overlooked in such discussions, interacts with the automobilised production of space in ways that both support automobility and generate contradictions. Five ambiguous "cultural ecologies" of automobility are explored—progress, privacy, identity, democratic mobility and autonomy.

Since its inception, the provincial government has worked to ensure that its sparsely distributed residents have access to the best communication services possible through the crown-owned SaskTel (formerly Saskatchewan Government Telephones). However, what was once a provincially owned and regulated monopoly has now been subject to federal regulation which favours competition in all sectors of the communication industry. The federal government adopted competition in the name of public interest, yet little has been done to assess the effectiveness of this claim. The current climate of uncertainty regarding new communication technologies, federal regulation, and the tide of provincial politics, have spoiled what was once an effective path for SaskTel and Saskatchewan citizens. It is clear that SaskTel's ability to meet its public policy goals is now threatened by the limitations of competition and federal regulation. <em>Telecommunication policy; Saskatchewan; Internet; Government policy Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight novels (2005-2008), Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games series (2008-2010), and Veronica Roth’s Divergent trilogy (2011-2013) serve as the primary, and I argue ideal case studies for this investigation. Emerging as top-selling YA series in the post-Harry Potter era, all three franchises feature teen girl protagonists with post-feminist “sensibility” (Gill), and with their mass appeal, have given rise to global fandoms. Hence, this project also examines reader responses to the series under discussion through a selection of online fan fiction in which female-identifying youth rewrite their protagonists as anorexic. Although media studies scholars have analyzed the gendered discourses surrounding contemporary female action heroes (Inness; Brown; Wright), and feminist literary scholars have explored how motifs of weight, starvation and consumption function within certain narratives (Daniel; Ellmann; Karlin; Meuret; Silver), the correlation between anorexia and action heroine texts has yet to be systematically studied. This investigation is all the more crucial given Parliament of Canada’s 2014 report, Eating Disorders Among Girls and Women in Canada, which notes that eating disorders have the highest mortality rates of all mental illnesses. Responding to the report’s call for increased research on media messaging aimed at youth, this dissertation focuses on mass media franchises targeted at girls and young women, the largest demographic of eating disorder sufferers, arguing that contemporary teen action heroine mythology reflects and reifies a problematic value system that mutually constitutes conceptions of starvation and justice, and informs the social construction of ideal femininity. This research thus forges new pathways between theories of girlhood, body image studies, and YA literature to offer a theoretical framework for reading female heroism that places the corporeal matrix of gender, consumption, and embodiment at its centre. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Looking toward the projector allows us to see how it is a productive labourer in the construction of cinematic experience. Listening to its noises— which have been framed as insignificant and/or unwanted—allows us to understand the way cinema is in fact a performative art with a certain kind of liveness. Part One of this dissertation traces an alternative history of cinema focused on the projector beginning with the pre-cinema technologies of the camera obscura, the telescope and the magic lantern. Part Two analyzes how the avant-garde has engaged with the projector-as-instrument during three major technological transitional moments in cinema: first, early cinema and the rise of the Cinématographe by looking at the Italian futurists, specifically Arnaldo Ginna and Bruno Corra’s interest in the projector-as-instrument and the relationship between the Cinématographe and Luigi Russolo’s intonarumori; second, the advent of sound-on-film technology and how it was used to produce synthetic noises by Oskar Fischinger, László Moholy-Nagy, Peter Kubelka and the author; and third, at the moment of the digital transition filmmakers like Bruce McClure and Karl Lemieux who have returned to explore the performativity and materiality of the projector in their artwork. At a time when the discourse of cinema is rife with rhetoric proclaiming its death (under threat of the digital revolution), this dissertation serves to establish that film is far from dead; through the projector-as-instrument, the future is bright… and very noisy. <em>audiovision; avant-garde; cinema; cinematic space; cinematic experience; film projector; media archeology; projector noise.

Drawing from a collection of over one hundred and sixty North American print advertisements for anti-aging skin care products from January to December of2009, my thesis examines the discourse of agelessness, a concept which has come to fruition over the past three decades. As a continuation of the semiotic project of the study of rhetoric and the motivated sign, my analysis moves beyond the basic level of signification to how agelessness is ordered, placed in hierarchical relation to our experiences of aging and age itself, where agelessness is accepted as a way out and transcendence of age. Through the use of advertisements as a reflection and reinforcement of the larger culture of anti-aging and resulting discourse of agelessness, my work functions to uncover, unpack, and understand the underlying order that moves through our everyday experiences and interactions with age and aging, to illuminate upon our current vision(s) of agelessness, illusively staring back at us from the reflective surface of the mythic fountain of youth. <em>Linguistics; Rhetoric; Mass communications; Marketing </em></p> </td>

It promotes the use of game design principles in the organization of every day environments, tasks and interactions. As an offspring of advanced communication technologies, gamification relies on the unhindered use of networked devices that transforms every experience into a user experience. Borrowing on the ubiquitous popularity of video games, the premise of gamification is the technologically enabled relationship between virtual causes and real-life effects, and its promise - a mutually beneficial coordination of corporate and personal interest. This dissertation outlines the socio-political implications of the concept of gamification through a critical examination of its content and intended meanings. The unpacking of gamification as an aspiration and a worldview reveals that as soon as we take for granted the equality of the sign and the signified, we also accept that life experiences do not exceed the signs we use to describe them. Therefore, to play life as a game, as gamifiers urge, is to live life by design. The definition I coin considers gamification from the perspective of political consequences, rather than practical application and mechanics. I work towards this definition by focusing on the rhetoric of gamification as an expressed intention that constructs motives and renegotiates beliefs. Hence, the theoretical model I apply draws on the work of two major theorists. American rhetorician and philosopher Kenneth Burke offers a theoretical apparatus for the study of the form and rhetorical devices of addressed messages. French semiotician and social theorist, Jean Baudrillard, informs the deconstruction of the claims gamification makes. The treatment of language as intention and action that is necessarily subjective and interested, offers a liminal stand-point from where the vision of a gamified world can be seen as an ideology which normalises itself by rhetorical means. Thus, I propose that the concept of gamification, whether applied in practice or not, is a political act. It constructs an ideology that seeks to reconcile the myth of the sacrosanct freedom of the Western individual with the constant imposition of corporate and government demands for compliance, accountability and efficiency. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Using a qualitative historical analysis and the theoretical tools of Marxism, this study argues that CSR and corporate public relations need to be viewed as modes of corporate power that have been historically deployed to re-assert and defend corporate hegemony in periods of democratic challenge and popular agitation. However, while originally deployed in tandem with corporate public relations, CSR has emerged in our current conjuncture as a profound source of corporate legitimacy in its own right. The success of CSR as a new mode of corporate legitimation is premised on its ability to constrain democratic pressures both discursively and materially; discursively through the ideological representation of the corporation as a benevolent and even democratic institution capable of regulating itself in the public interest; and materially through the promotion of corporate-inspired policies and regimes of corporate governance that allow for the private appropriation of previously public goods and functions of democratic government. This duality of CSR is most manifest in the corporate response to environmental crisis, which has strained not only the legitimacy of the corporation but also that of the capitalist system of production. This study investigates the tactics through which CSR has enabled business to transform itself into the preeminent environmental steward while simultaneously advancing policies that further corporate interests while circumscribing avenues for popular participation in issues of environmental concern. Therefore, CSR should be viewed not only as a strategy to curtail democratic opposition to corporate power, but also a means to expand and deepen corporate power as it is used to grant ever-greater autonomy and authority to corporations over areas previously deemed the sole purview of the democratic state. <em>corporate power; corporate public relations; corporate social responsibility; environmentalism; environmental crisis; democracy; ecology; Marxism.

Assuming that photography and education not only show people their world, but that they also offer them the means to help create it, this essay explores the various ways that social forces have kept people from the democratic possibilities such institutions offer. Indeed, since they are typically controlled by state and corporate interests, photographic institutions and public education systems, as well as their specific representations and practices, typically reinforce a hegemonic order rather than challenge it. Through these institutions such forces have shown and taught us only a limited version of what constitutes our lives by structuring and ordering the material conditions and symbolic spaces of our world, including many of our own thoughts, actions, and experiences. This essay suggests that the critical tendencies of the few alternative photographic and popular educational practices that challenge this order continue to collaborate and develop systematic practices designed to challenge depoliticizing forces, particularly by investigating the spaces most immediately accessible to a large portion of the population: the public school classroom. <em>Photography; Education </em></p> </td>

The emergent, participatory, and inclusive characteristics of these diverse practices are increasingly common in contemporary art and culture, with cooperative processes, community activism, formal experimentation, and public involvement being regarded, now more than ever, as legitimate strategies for developing artistic form and content. This project considers the innovative uses of cameras in these practices, arguing that such uses are not simply convenient or instrumental, but are often critical mediations between visual realism and cultural expressivity. The dissertation begins to address a gap in research on material practices in the cultural production of art by elaborating a theory of socially engaged camera arts. Drawn from ethnographic research in the Toronto community arts/socially engaged arts ecology, this theory begins to describe how camera practices seem to be moving beyond traditional image production practices in order to support and even help envision broader repertoires of practice in processes of social and cultural action. The dissertation develops three interrelated theoretical frames - expansion, organization and pedagogy - to insist on the key place of socially engaged camera arts, and camera arts in general, in the iterative, activist-led revitalization of community cultural infrastructures. <em>Cameras in art; Art and social action; Toronto Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Through semi-structured interviews with infinifat subjects and a secondary discourse analysis of “superfat” narratives in popular texts, this research finds that a lack of clothing options reinforces the stigma and discrimination experienced by those at the largest end of the fat spectrum. Particularly, the lack of clothing available to superfat and infinifat people restricts access to social spaces and economic opportunities. While this research draws attention to ways in which my infinifat participants are “hacking” fashion to suit their needs and using social media to advocate for inclusion, the fashion industry’s unwillingness to create clothing options for superfat and infinifat people, supports the perception that being really fat is really bad. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Since the 1970s, there has been a growing number of graduate training programs designed to equip a new generation of graduates with the kind of awareness necessary to address the global ecological crisis. Despite these efforts, the crisis on the whole continues to worsen. Although scholars have pointed to the challenges that ecological consciousness poses for graduate training and research, few studies have examined these challenges from the point of view of graduate students themselves. To better understand the opportunities and constraints of graduate training and research, this dissertation uses the framework of ecological consciousness to analyze the experiences of an international group of twenty-six graduate students and professionals trained in ecosystem approaches to human health (ecohealth) in Canada, West and Central Africa, and Central America. Drawing on systems thinking, Indigenous knowledges, and historical materialism, I argue that ecological consciousness means using different ways of knowing to challenge the disciplining tendency of academic knowledge production and open space for a wider ecology of knowledge to develop and express itself. Methodologically, this project is informed by institutional ethnography, building on the diverse experiences and insights of interviewees to make sense of the layered contextual frames of the university, the state, and international development research projects. Despite an orientation toward transformative practices, interviewee experiences reveal strong pressures to fit within top-down, disciplinary processes already governing the administration of training and research, thereby limiting the possibilities for ecological consciousness. I conclude by offering certain theoretical possibilities for how ecological consciousness can support collective action upon the disciplinary employment structures, which graduate students and professionals have a key role in transforming. <em>Environmental health; Research; Human ecology; Health aspects; Human beings; Effect of environment on; Environmental management </em></p> </td>

First, it will investigate Thompson and Stegemann's theory that suggests that for performing arts organizations, brand and brand equity are contributed to by a number of different sources, each of which may have their own brand and brand equity ("Brand Equity and the Cultural Event: The Amalgamation of Multiple Brands for a Unified Marketing Communications Performance", 2). The multi-faceted composition of brand equity will be examined with a specific application to potential impact on corporate sponsorship. Each of the key elements that contribute to brand equity will be examined with specific reference to the potential benefits and hazards they may bring to a corporate sponsorship relationship. Secondly, this paper will propose the addition of four additional sources of brand equity to those proposed by Thompson and Stegemann. These sources will also be evaluated for relevance to corporate sponsorship. It is hoped that this paper and further studies into non-profit brand will balance the brand equation in arts sponsorship relationships, where traditional emphasis has been placed on the brand of the donor.

There has been an increase in new non-cisgender, non-straight identity words since the creation of the internet, thanks to social media platforms like Tumblr. Tumblr in particular has been host to many conversations about identity and self-naming, though these conversations have not yet been the subject of much academic research. Through interviews and analysis of Tumblr posts, this thesis examines the emergence of new identity words, or neo-identities, used by non-cisgender and non-straight users of Tumblr. The work presents neo-identities as strategies for resisting and challenging cisheteronormative conceptions of gender and attraction, as well as sources of comfort and relief for non-cisgender/non-straight people who feel ‘broken’ and excluded from mainstream identity categories. This thesis also posits that Tumblr is uniquely suited for conversations about identity because of its potential for self-expression, community, and anonymity. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

This intersection is at the centre of Toronto's retail and entertainment district and, as such, has been labelled "The Heart of Toronto." In 1998, plans began to redevelop the corner of Yonge and Dundas. The redevelopment of the area was part of an ongoing plan to revitalize Toronto's downtown core. Yonge-Dundas Square opened in 2002. What began as a project to improve the image of Toronto has resulted in an environment of images which resembles Times Square, and the Los Angeles of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982; Director's Cut, 1993), more than anything else. The redevelopment project at Yonge and Dundas relates to broader economic, political and technological shifts currently taking place as part of the process of neo-liberal globalization and, through these initiatives an essential aspect of Toronto's local culture has been lost, buckling to the commodification of public space. Drawing upon the commercial image space at Yonge-Dundas Square, this work questions how the ideology of neo-liberalism in the new global economy corresponds to the restructuring of urban public space, and, conversely; how postmodern image space structures the imagination of the citizen/consumer for the benefit of the emerging neo-liberal political and economic powers. This study employs a broad range of cultural theory and a method of visual analysis to investigate the kind of social control that has been built into the cultural environments of cities such as Toronto. This approach is based upon the Marxist notion of Phantasmagoria which stands as a metaphor for the way in which the relationship between knowledge and action blinds individuals from the social impact of ideology.

I argue that while early film theorists sought to develop a theory of film, film theory better serves the study and critique of ideology. I claim that the study of film and spectatorship can add to knowledge of ideology and subjectivity. To this end, I examine the relevance of the Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst, Slavoj Žižek, for contemporary film studies. I locate Žižek's place within film studies through a debate between himself and the prominent American film scholar, David Bordwell. Bordwell is well known for his advocacy of cognitive and middle-level research in film studies, and for his criticism of film theory (or, 'Theory'). He is one of the leaders of a movement in film studies known as post-Theory. I take up the debate between Žižek and Bordwell, and argue that the post-Theory rejection of Theory is an ideological effect of the class struggle. After carving out a place for Žižek in film studies, I examine the relevance of his psychoanalytic interpretations of cinema for a critique of ideology. Žižek is known for using examples from films as tools of exegesis for an interpretation of Lacanian psychoanalysis. However, I argue that while this is true for some of his writing on film, Žižek also practices a psychoanalytic interpretation of cinema that reveals something about the function of ideology. Referring to Žižek, I also argue against early film theorists who thought it possible to interpellate political subjectivities through alternative or avant-garde cinema. In contrast, I argue that the work itself in not powerful enough to interpellate political subjectivity. It is, rather, the interpretation that politicizes the work. I claim that films do not create subject-positions, as early film theorists argued; rather, they reproduce the already existing subject-positions of the spectators by reproducing pleasure or desire. However, without rejecting the efforts of early film theory, I conclude, against Bordwell and other post-Theorists, that Theory is still important in film studies, particularly in the area of political critique, and that Žižek's work is exemplary of the kind of political criticism needed in film studies. <em>avant-garde cinema; David Bordwell; film theory; ideology; Jacques Lacan; Marxism; Post-Theory; psychoanalysis; spectatorship; subjectivity; Slovoj Žižek.

A non-dual methodology borrowed from Martin Heidegger combines the materialist media theory of Friedrich Kittler with Bernard Steigler's teleological philosophy of technics. This perspective is employed to analyze the literature and film of science fiction, and in particular, the recent television series, Battlestar Galactica. This analysis permits the elaboration of a communications ontology that at once highlights the individual (human) and systemic (material) aspects of the life world, and ultimately delivers an articulation of Being that is systemic and individual. It attempts to transcend traditional subject object distinctions and to naturalize the theoretical progression from biological to technical life by suggesting that human being is always already hybrid technical being, and that technological being is not only a logical, but also perhaps necessary product of Western cultural progression. <em>Battlestar Galactica; Bernard Steigler; communications-based ontology; film; Friedrich Kittler; literature; Martin Heidegger; materialist media theory; mechanical life; philosophy of technics; science fiction; television.

I displace avant-garde preoccupations with radiation, speed, time and space overcome, disembodiment, ghosts, and schizophonia; tempering them with ideas of resonance, slowness, hearing distance and experiencing time, technology as embodied aggregate circuits of humans and things, transception, and minor media. By expanding Bertolt Brecht's notion of transception through a critical theory of technology as a central concept for re-theorizing transmission, communication and media culture, I consider which alternate radio territories might emerge if the utopian desires to exceed our current capacities through wireless technologies are set aside in favour of embodied, transceptive relationships with others, human and non-human. Through the creation of three new radio art installation and performance works You are far from us, Respire, and The Joy Channel (created with Emmanuel Madan), I consider how bodies remain present and affective in wirelessness through choices of circuit, performance strategies, and compositional elements; theoretically and practically reconsidering radio in terms of transmission ecology and minor media. I propose and begin to test the notion of a resonant rather than radiant paradigm for transmission by emphasizing micro-radio narrowcasting and interference in radio art creation, drawing upon contemporary notions of Hertzian space in which humans and things serve as radiogenic actants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This dissertation considers creative practice as research, in which radio art/works function as experiments that aim to generate and contribute to theoretical knowledge. These works, which were variably narrowcast and broadcast multi-channel radio transmissions, 'performed installations', and live radio theatre, repurposed very common technology (terrestrial FM radio broadcasting) and reframed the relationships in which transmission takes place. This simple appropriation of technology undermines the broadcast model of radio that has been naturalized for the past century, while providing opportunities in which to imagine future circumstances which could deepen circuits of relationship If radio to date has largely acted as an accomplice in the industrialization of communications, art radio and radio art continue to destabilize this process with renewed explorations of radio and electromagnetic phenomena, and the softly subversive potential of reverie. <em>Fine arts; Art history; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Installation; Performance art; Radio art; Transmission ecology </em></p> </td>

As depicted in the painting, habitues of differing social, political and artistic backgrounds have come together to socialize with other artists, enjoy the food displayed in the foreground, and view the new work painted by their hostess; in fact, Florine herself is represented in the nude in a large canvas in the centre of the painting with the guests delicately turning their backs to the painting. This ironic painting of a live salon scene at the Stettheimers allows viewers a glimpse into a social, cultural, and artistic institution that has remained somewhat under researched in the ways in which it defies some of the rules of mainstream society. Sociability, evoked in the epigraph, was also the focus of Rachel Varnhagen's early nineteenth-century salon in Berlin, a space in which racial and gender boundaries were crossed. Located in the private domestic space of somebody's home, the salon was an influential social institution and a vehicle that ultimately empowered women as this essay will document by exploring Rahel Varnhagen and Florine Stettheimer's important careers as salonieres. As this essay will argue, the salon especially empowered doubly marginalized Jewish women and allowed them to overcome limitations of the traditional roles considered appropriate for Jewish women who were able to claim strong intellectual, social, and artistic identities by using the salon as their vehicle. <em>Florine Stettheimer; gender and sexuality; Jewish identity; Rahel Varnhagen; racial barriers; salon; salonière; salon culture; social change; women artists.

Two Ryerson University courses in Information Technology Management that require students to use weblogs are taken as examples. Twenty-two students from these two courses participated in an online survey concerning their blogging experience. The participants had very good computer knowledge - most of them had previous experience using blogs. Most of them thought that building and maintaining a blog was an easy task. However, the research shows that students' perception concerning the use of blogs as educational tools was neutral-students also perceived the impact of using blogs on their ability to learn the course material as neutral. The study shows a lack of clear communication between instructors and students, which could have had a negative impact on students' learning experience. Furthermore, the study indicates that most students perceived the content they posted in a somewhat negative way. A content analysis performed on 22 blogs demonstrates that that the objectives of each course played a significant impact on the evidences of learning apparent in students' blogs. Students in group B demonstrated more evidences of learning then students in group A. Overall, the study shows that the use of blogs as learning tool in university classrooms is promising. Providing students with clear goals, objectives and expectations could help them to build and maintain their blogs in a way that could be more beneficial to their learning experience. <em>Internet in higher education; educational technology; effect of technological innovations on blogs </em></p> </td>

Yet when it comes to regularly scheduled professional games, that audience dramatically decreases. In 2019, low audience numbers led to the closure of the Canadian Women’s Hockey League and put the future of professional women’s hockey in jeopardy. As with many women’s sports, broadcasters argue the cost of production is too great, the value of airtime minutes too high to take the financial risk of televising the women’s game without guaranteeing viewers for advertisers. Activists and athletes argue that the audience must be built through broadcaster investment. While scholars have examined hockey for its representational power to define national and gendered identities, there has been shockingly little research into the hockey audience. This mixed method audience reception study seeks to explore the viewing inconsistencies of the audience for women’s hockey. Quantitative results from an online survey (n =685) provided data about viewing habits, perceptions and knowledge. This data informed qualitative focus groups (n = 25) that in turn provided contextualization and reasoning for the quantitative data. Mixed method analysis intersected grounded theory with audience reception, sport media, feminist studies and affect theory to identify a persistent discursive strategy framing women’s hockey as “pure” for resisting the crass commercialization, incessant violence and individualistic star system of professional men’s hockey. I argue that women’s hockey becomes the manifestation of the Canadian myth of hockey; men’s hockey as it used to be. As a nostalgic placeholder devoid of context, contemporary women’s hockey functions within a double bind; virtuous and elevated yet non-viable as a commercial enterprise. This ensures that the sport remains precarious at best. “Pure” women’s hockey also functions as a postfeminist essentializing discourse that solves the gender risk of hockey’s hypermasculinity while disavowing women’s physically aggressive play and sport media’s affective currency. Whereas Olympic women’s hockey relies on patriotic pride for audience affective engagement, professional women’s hockey is framed by cognitive contradictions, “pure” but commercial, gender normative but transgressive. Confused and disconnected from the game and players, audiences are left unaffected. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

There are indications that her image does not reflect her achievements in science, technology and industry. Outdated and inaccurate perceptions of Canada in the world can have negative implications for her economic well-being as well as her ability to effectively participate in world affairs and international development. The thesis considers whether Radio Canada International (RCI) can help in producing an appropriate image of Canada and serve her national and international objectives. It scrutinizes the organization, present state and past performance of RCI as well as contextualizing the broadcaster within certain social and political trends in the country. The thesis concludes that RCI can help Canada in realizing her potential as a valuable player on the world stage and suggests that it should be assigned additional broadcasting responsibilities to this end. <em>Radio Canada International; International broadcasting; Radio broadcasting; Canada; Foreign public opinion.

The Mennonites carry a complicated legacy including migration to North America due to persecution, and at the same time contribution to the colonial national project by virtue of being there. Through an examination of Roland Barthes’ theory of myth, Sara Ahmed’s sticky objects, Doreen Massey’s concepts of space, and Susan M.

One of the ways this is accomplished is through the use of authority; the active decision by media outlets to invoke the trust we have in certain voices while reflecting and shaping our notions of the roles of others. When given the choice between experts, political leaders, victims, etc., all genders and cultural backgrounds, whose voices are heard in mainstream media, and as a result, whose influence is reflected in the public's understanding of the world; an understanding so crucial to a functioning democracy?

This paper will identify that there are diverse Western cultural conceptions surrounding the hero. It is therefore important to trace the meaning behind the concept and draw conclusions as to whether or not the hero narrative has developed or shifted over time. Through an intensive review of the literature on the "hero," this research paper critically identifies the historical constructions, empirical observations, and theoretical analyses in order to explore and understand how the hero narrative has changed or retained timeless qualities of meaning or myth. As the hero developed from the Classical times to the present, through the periods of oral tradition to electronic media, those who are identified as a "hero" became more and more far-reaching. This paper constructs several empirical tables that identify similarities and differences concerning how Western society's classification of heroes has developed. By taking into account the different types of heroic figures that have existed across time, including Greek gods, soldiers, community workers, and celebrities, this paper establishes whether or not the conception of the "hero" changes depending on war, gender, race, popular culture, historical time period, and changes in communication technology. <em>celebrity; communication technology; community workers; electronic media; hero/heroine; hero narrative; gender and sexuality; myth; oral tradition; popular culture; race. </em></p> </td>

Text messaging, instant messaging and social networking sites are increasingly replacing embodied forms of communication as the preferred method for building and maintaining even the most intimate of relationships. The ability to manage one's performance within these regulated and highly-edited communicative spaces consequently emphasizes the vulnerability of the embodied social self, engaging in real space and time. The potential for failure inherent to any embodied social interaction is increasingly prevalent as a theme across a variety of entertainment media, suggesting that concerns with embodied communication performances are widespread. In this paper I will illustrate how representations of this communicative breakdown and the resulting moments of "awkward" silence form the basis for a new sub-genre of television comedy that includes both the British and American versions of The Office, Peep Show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Parks and Recreation and Modern Family, among others. I contend that the popularity of these programs is a function of their adoption of unique aesthetic elements that reflect and address anxieties surrounding changing communicative norms specific to life in a highly-mediated social environment. <em>American television; awkward sitcom; British television; comedy theory; Curb Your Enthusiasm; Modern Family; Parks and Recreation; Peep Show; performance of communication; popular culture; social life; television comedy; The Office.

Taking a political economy approach, the paper provides an introduction to spectrum governance and, using the Policy Objectives of the Telecommunications Act and the goals for using auctions as a spectrum allocation method, analyzes the outcomes of the 700 MHz auction. It argues that neoliberal policy preferences by the governing party were ineffective at producing a more open and objective process or achieving significant social and cultural gains, and increasing, if not maximizing, auction revenues came at the expense of alternative options that may have better served the public good through increased rural coverage and more affordable services. While changes within the policy environment did contribute to an evolution of spectrum assignment policy by Industry Canada between the 2008 AWS and 2014 700 MHz auctions, it was the ability of the ruling Conservative’s to claim economic populist reforms that was the main outcome, not smart telecommunication policy. <em>&nbsp;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Using concepts from Gowans, Greenhalgh, Mortenson, Shiner, and Bourdieu's theory of the field of cultural production, this thesis traces the sociology and art history of the division between traditional and modern art that led to the formation of the Island Illustrators Society in 1985 in Victoria, British Columbia. I argue illustration is an original, theoretical art form indistinguishable from but alienated by contemporary art, that conservative art is neither static nor irrelevant, and that non-commercial contemporary art is a misnomer. I find the Society challenged the definitions of art and illustration by promoting illustrative fine art and by transcending binary oppositions of conservative and contemporary, commercial and non-commercial. <em>Commercial art; Art; Illustrators; Island Illustrators Society Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

In addition to the problems specific to the Canadian publishing industry- for example, federal and provincial funding cuts to the industry; the monopoly of the book retail market by the chain outlet Chapters-Indigo; the difficulty and expense of book distribution within Canada; competition from multinational publishing companies; the lack and expense of traditional marketing opportunities- the growing global market for books presents further difficulties for an industry that is struggling to retain its "Canadian" focus. This study considers the recent impact, both positive and negative, of globalization on the Canadian book industry, with a specific focus on publishers as the key figures in this industry. By surveying three publishing houses that represent specific segments of the industry- large multinational, mid-size, and small presses- I examine different approaches to surviving in the current book market and offer several conclusions about the future of Canadian publishing, most notably that the larger the publishing house, the less it is troubled by challenging market conditions. <em>Publishers and publishing; globalization </em></p> </td>

Data protection is a pressing issue not only because files of personal information are being kept in greater detail and for longer periods of time, but also because the data can be retrieved and compared or matched without delay, regardless of geography. While defenders of information technology cite efficiency and safety among the countervailing benefits, concerns from an increasingly tech-savvy public have introduced a sense of urgency to demand tough legislation. Although many studies have provided evidence of online privacy concerns, few have explored the nature of the concern in detail, especially in terms of government policy for our new online environment. Bill C-6, Canada's recent legislative action, has provided a practical basis from which to appraise governments' role in privacy protection. With this in mind, the paper will be divided into two parts. Part one will be undertaken to: (A) evaluate the arguments of critics as well as defenders of contemporary record-keeping practices and the philosophical conceptions of privacy, which underlie them; and, using these themes (B) provide a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of Bill C- 6, examining the ways in which policy makers have begun to treat privacy as both a commodity and a secondary adjunct to business activity. Part two of the paper, purposes a series of recommendations or, more specifically, a framework for Bill C-6 that would, more effectively, protect individual privacy from private entities, who collect online data. <em>Internet; Law and legislation; Canada; Electronic records; Electronic data interchange; Privacy; Public records.

The approaches of CDA, framing and branding intersect around language and power and are therefore beneficial for combining in any analysis that seeks to identify the socio-cultural influences on the text, such as the reiteration of dominant discourses within the text. This research examined news articles selected from The Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, two mainstream Canadian newspapers with the highest circulation. The news articles show that Jane-Finch is portrayed in a negative and stereotypical way by both newspapers. These findings support the view that news discourse is as ideologically-bound as other forms of discourse, despite claims to its objectivity. As a consequence of being ideologically-bound, a fundamental attribution error is enacted in news coverage on Jane-Finch, as coverage repeatedly attributed the problems in Jane-Finch to race and immigrants (internal factors) and ignored the more substantive contributing factors of discrimination, structural constraints, poverty and joblessness (external structural factors). More generally, the analysis shows that news about Jane-Finch tends to be negative and therefore obscures any positive developments in the community. Sustained repetition of the same news stories brands the community with a negative reputation and promotes a false stereotype of its residents. Not only is news capable of agenda-setting (bringing certain issues to the forefront), but in repeatedly showcasing issues the same way all the time, a ‘branding effect’ (similar to the process in corporate branding) is enacted. A ‘domino effect’ results in that negative branding of Jane-Finch affects property values, prevents educational and job opportunities for its residents and reduces economic development of the area. Ultimately, this can cause misrecognition of the ‘real’ problems affecting the community, preventing the development of effective community and policy responses to these issues. The thesis not only contributes knowledge in the area of branding and the news but also contributes in the area of policy-making related to low-income communities and the poor. Policy-makers need to address external structural factors affecting these areas and pay less attention to the ‘sensational’ areas showcased by the media. For example, because of the focus on crime in the news media, policymakers may think more stringent crime laws are needed when if other issues, such as ensuring jobs for the young, are addressed, youth crime would lessen. <em>Canadian studies; Ethnic studies; Mass communications; Discourse analysis;</em></p> <p><em>News media; Low income groups </em></p> </td>

This paper examines the disconnection between human beings and the natural environment. It argues that this disconnection is caused by the importance the Western culture accords rationality over other, more intuitive modes of perception and experience. My project aims to remedy this problem by targeting perception and reworking it through a more demanding of the audience approach in my compositions. The all-over composition of my photographic collages encourages the eyes to scan around the entire image. This scanning of the image, I strongly believe, disrupts the dominant mode of visual perception in the modem Western world, in which the figure is viewed as a distant isolated object that can be grasped immediately rather than engaged with and contemplated. I argue that this scanning attention encourages unconscious participation, allowing viewers to find their own connections and visual paths through the forest I have created. In this way the viewer is given space for contemplation and reflection; an experience that is often undervalued in our society. This paper asserts that by employing unconscious scanning attention, visual perception can be retrained, thereby destabilizing the dominant modes of thinking and experiencing. I argue that the unconscious modes of perception, intuition, and imagination play a key role in the re-connection to nature, for when we are unable to connect and empathize with the natural environment, our capacity to connect and empathize with others also diminishes. Therefore, the path towards a more ethically aware society is through the arts and the unconscious. This paper emphasizes that the desire to regard, contemplate, empathize, and love another living being, whether human or non-human, is the path towards a more peaceful, connected world. <em>arts; creative process; empathy; human and nonhuman; natural environment; photographic collages; visual perception; Western culture.

Following its historic use in programs of propaganda, public diplomacy, psychological operations, and international development communication, the practice of IRB can also be found in a number of post-conflict statebuilding operations that are not well documented. Through a case study methodology this dissertation examines the nature of, and motivation for, the use of IRB in post-conflict state-building, as experienced by Canada’s Rana FM in contemporary Afghanistan (2006 – 2011). Using primary research from structured interviews with IRB practitioners and personal observation of IRB operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Afghanistan, this study draws on information from directing staff, management, producers, on-air presenters, and technical staff; as well as a variety of sources including internal content analyses, opinion polling, and unclassified government documents. Using the strategic communication frameworks of propaganda and development communication, this study found IRBs to function as a form of ‘defensive propaganda’ that aims to reinforce the institutions of the developing state during the process of democratic reconstruction. IRBs in post-conflict state-building can be seen to function in a surrogate capacity that aims to become a creditable source of news and information, in order to maximize audience share and provide a platform for public discussion. This dissertation presents new empirical information on Canada’s IRB in Afghanistan, Rana FM, which operated from January 2007 to July 2011. <em>Afghanistan; Bosnia-Herzegovina; Canada; developmental communication; international radio broadcasting; Kosovo; mass communication; news media; propaganda.

What does the term serial say? It draws on series - a term often used in reference to novels, films and, quite literally, the television series. Series carries notions of multiple segments that are all linked in some way. There is an ongoing nature to the series - when one segment ends, another begins. The series creates anticipation, anxiety of what is to come and a hope for closure. As "serial killer" is a relatively new term it becomes possible to trace its inception and examine what is being revealed in this naming process. I then go to illustrate how this term serial is what sets serial killing apart from other forms of multiple murder (such as mass murder, spree killing, terrorism and assassination). I will explore the features of the serial killer that appear to make it unique to the collective by developing the language of the accounts of understanding the serial killer: the profiling account, the study of numbers, facts and statistics as a way to apprehend and comprehend the serial killer; the logical extension of society account, where the serial killer is a reflection of society from concerns with the individual to celebrity and consumerism; and the serial killer account, where the serial killer explains his own motivations. In looking at these accounts it becomes possible to see the cliches that are used to discuss the serial killer and how these reveal thoughts and fears of the collective, rather than providing the insight on the serial killer that the accounts are seeking. <em>assassination; celebrity; communication and culture; consumerism; film; individualism; mass media; mass murder; news media; novels; serial killers; storytelling; television; terrorism.

Empirical methods including semi-structured interviews with ten families and observations of play were mobilized to get a sense of how game play is gendered in everyday life. The results demonstrate how parental and youth practices can serve to reaffirm gendered associations between technological proficiencies and pleasures and masculine and feminine subject-positions. Such relationships are articulated through two mutually constitutive regulatory systems – the rule systems put into place by parents about time for, content of, and spaces dedicated to digital play activities, alongside the disciplinary system of normative gender performance that perpetuates an association between technological mastery and masculinity while troubling any such relationship between feminine subjects and tech savvy. The participants in this study engaged with the pressures of an increasingly neoliberal ethos in everyday life, particularly visions of the opportunities offered by these technologies as well as the potential risks underlying certain forms of engagement. Parents and children alike regulated play, thus challenging and reaffirming hegemonic configurations of legitimate forms of digital play linking to essentialized conceptions of gender. <em>Womens studies; Individual &amp; family studies; Mass communications; Information science; Social sciences; Communication and the arts; Digital games; Game play; Gender; Home; Technological subjects </em></p> </td>

The computer has "transformed the way we live, work and play". Communication devices are driving the development of technology standards that are very powerful for consumers, but even more powerful and profitable for the companies that control them. A battle continues for control over the way we access information online via Web browsers on computers and mobile devices. The owner of the most popular interface has an advantage because it can influence how the public sees information, favouring some content over others. But more importantly, it profits from selling access to these viewers to advertisers and it can choose who it will allow to advertise and who it will block. <em>advertising; Android; cell phone; cell phone browser; Google; Google Chrome; marketing; open access; open source software; web browser.

Having been initially limited to text, the now ubiquitous setting of social networking sites allows us to digitally reconstruct ourselves through a pastiche-like approach. Through the abstractive processes outlined by Guy Debord, the modern online subcultural subject is able to create a digital 'self' th[r]ough a series of pictorial, textual, and multi-media (music, and video) based inclusions. In doing so, these inclusions become abstracted into 'spectacular' representations of self, where mere appearance becomes key. In presenting the processes that take place in the MySpace setting to abstract subcultural identity, it will be shown that the interconnected and instantaneous nature of the modern communicative landscape negates the possibility of online subcultural groups in their traditional form. <em>MySpace; Online social networks; Internet; Subculture; Group identity Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

How did these terms of engagement relate to the role magazines played in emerging mass culture? My dissertation investigates these questions using evidence from four popular periodicals between 1885 and 1918: the Graphic, the Illustrated London News, Pearson’s Magazine, and the Strand. Readers possessed a print media literacy through which they could interpret the material traces of production that were part of a periodical’s aesthetics and situate a print object in its real and imagined socio-technological contexts, a capacity I describe as the technological imagination. Print media literacy also enabled readers to attend to how a physical print object mediated culture, which I describe as medial awareness. Combining close reading with historical contextualization and a media archaeological emphasis on materiality, I analyze aesthetic characteristics of these four illustrated magazines that influenced reader engagement by invoking readers’ technological imagination. At the turn of the century, the Illustrated London News and other popular illustrated magazines underwent what Gaudreault and Marion would call a “second birth,” repositioning themselves within the era’s new media milieu. The increasingly visual and multimodal aesthetics of these periodicals engaged readers’ technological imagination and drew their attention to mediation itself. Using de Certeau’s theory of strategy and tactic, I argue that periodical producers strategically invoked the technological imagination to acquire cultural authority, but readers could use their medial awareness to poach producer techniques, becoming critical and productive agents of mass culture. In news weeklies such as the Illustrated London News and the Graphic, advertisers encouraged readers to conflate reading and consumption, but readers could appropriate advertising strategies using curatorial and hyper-reading tactics. In monthlies such as Pearson’s, population journalism prompted readers to conceptualize themselves using a “biopolitical” rubric of normalization, in Foucault’s sense, but this genre’s spectacular strategies created space for readers to exert tactical agency. In “Curiosities,” a participatory feature in the Strand, readers used the technological imagination to appropriate multimodal magazine production and contribute to what Flichy terms the “socio-technical frame of reference” for the hand camera. As “Curiosities” demonstrates, late-Victorian illustrated periodicals influenced the terms of user engagement for twentieth- and twenty-first-century mass media. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

This paper will illustrate how the transition to digital television and High Definition (HDTV) technology will fundamentally change the way a television program is produced, broadcast, distributed, and viewed by the audience. It is anticipated that this changeover will significantly alter the economic business models of broadcasters, producers, and broadcast distribution undertakings. It will also affect programming services, while completely restructuring the technical infrastructure of the industry. Therefore, the significance of this changeover has been compared by many as being similar to the switch from black and white to colour television in the 1950s (Brace, 2007; Brinkley, 1997; Galperin, 2004; Hart, 2004; Heidendahl, 2007). <em>High definition television; Television broadcasting; Technological innovations; Television; Transmitters and transmission; Television; Receivers and reception; High definition television; Government policy Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Warren Susman characterizes the period as one marked by a "dual consciousness," a time when "the fulfillment of our sweetest desires [led] inevitably to the brink of danger and damnation"; the fifties, he writes, was an age of anxiety as much as it was a time of abundance, freedom, and possibility (30). For historian David Halberstam, while a retrospective examination of the decade suggests to some a "slower, almost languid" pace, social ferment "was beginning just beneath this placid surface" (ix). Throughout the decade, notions of national security played out in conflicting ways that traversed both the public and private spheres. Science fiction, a genre that coincided with massive industry changes that saw the development of a sizable low-budget, teen-oriented independent sector, resonated deeply with such opposing and anxiety-laden articulations of both public and private security. While most previous discussions of the genre tend to focus on such concerns in their public dimension (particularly as related to political unease during the Cold War), what follows will address sci-fi' s depiction of anxieties in that other, more private realm of American society, particularly in relation to the expression of gender, sexuality, and desire. Cold War politics, the postwar consumer boom, re-entrenchment of family values and suburban home life, and industry upheavals in Hollywood are all important for understanding what is now thought of as the golden age of American science fiction film. These socio-political factors contextualize the genre's rise to prominence, its defining stylistic and thematic characteristics, and its treatment of gendered subjectivity. As we will see, while some science fiction films of the 1950s engaged or challenged cultural rhetoric related to expected norms of gendered behaviour, for the most part these films upheld the era's return to more traditional gender roles for men and women, an observation which has been taken up in the critical literature, particularly within feminist film scholarship. However, within this body of films exists a common and recurring convention that has been largely neglected by science fiction film scholars, one that warrants further study due to its implications for understanding the return to domesticity in the American postwar period. This filmic convention is the scream, a visual and aural articulation of fear expressed mostly by women (but also, and just as importantly, by men). Far from being a mere cheap gimmick employed by filmmakers alongside special effects and insatiable monsters, the scream provides valuable insight into the domestic ideologies that prevailed during the 1950s. <em>American film; cinema; domesticity; domestic ideology; feminism; feminist film studies; film; gender and sexuality; gender roles; Hollywood; popular culture; mass media; postwar American culture; science fiction; theatre; video.

Using Twitter, this project involves writing a 10,000-word Twitter auto-fiction piece, based on a traumatic series of autobiographical events experienced as a teenager. Utilizing an automated tweeting tool, the piece unfolds in a stream-of-consciousness manner characteristic of the medium, exploring the phenomenological reality of individuals writing the rich novels of their lives over social media. Thinkers like Macej Cegłowski warn that the internet maps poorly on concepts of how human memory works, as binary memory percolates up into the design of online communities. This system of forever-memory, in which any comment and photo can be screen-capped and stored, works against how individuals prefer to remember – especially, perhaps, very young people, millions of whom live their “embarrassing teen years” in public, and in stunning detail. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

The nomination forms for the French gastronomic meal and Mexican traditional cuisine reign in the symbolic meaning of their food traditions through the process of definition and description, connecting them to territory, national history, and kinship in order to promote fixed and essentialized national culinary identities. Through an examination of the nominations submitted by each respective Member State, I show how the intangible becomes tangible and how this tangibility serves to assuage anxieties over contamination, the dissolution of the nation state, and the fading away of historical narratives. Embedding and fixing these traditions within place portrays the nation as a site of agency with a unique (and, more problematically, fixed) cultural identity. Taking on solid form, these traditions also come to narrate collective pasts, providing a place for those in the present as cultural protectors and propagators. <em>Canada; cultural identity; food cultures; food production and consumption; food studies; food traditions; national culinary identity; nationalist history; Toronto; UNESCO.

This technology enables American Sign Language (ASL) asynchronous communication, called vlogging, for Deaf people. The thesis provides new insights and implications for Deaf culture and communication as a result of studying the practices, opinions and attitudes of vlogging. Typical asynchronous communication media such as blogs, books, e-mails, or movies have been dependent on use of spoken language or text, not incorporating sign language content. Online video and website technologies make it possible for Deaf people to share signed content through video blogs (vlogs), and to have a permanent record of that content. Signed content is typically 3-D, shared during face-to-face gatherings, and ephemeral in nature. Websites are typically textual and video display is 2-D, placing constraints on the spatial modulation required for ASL communication. There have been few academic studies to date examining signed asynchronous communication use by Deaf people and the implications for Deaf culture and communication. In this research, 130 vlogs by Deaf vloggers on the mainstream website YouTube, and specialized website Deafvideo.TV were examined to discover strategies employed by Deaf users as a result of the technology’s spatial limitations, and to explore similarities and differences between the two websites. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 Deaf people as follow up. The main findings from this research include register of vlogging formality depending on website type, informal on Deafvideo.TV while formal on YouTube. In addition, vlogs had flaming behaviour while unexpected findings of lack of ASL literature and use of technical elements that obscured ASL content in vlogs. Questions regarding the space changes and narrative elements observed have arisen, providing avenues for additional research. This study and more research could lead to a fuller understanding the impact of vlogging and vlogging technology on Deaf culture and identify potential improvements or new services that could offered. <em>Video blogs; deaf culture; Identity (Philosophical concept); internet videos; telecommunications devices for the deaf </em></p> </td>

This research paper aims to address this question, with primary focus on the impact of digital conversion on 35mm film projection, the established standard for motion picture film, and the potential ramifications for both the medium and film culture. This will include an overview of the contemporary debate over which medium is best for production, distribution, and, most significantly, exhibition, which will involve the opinions of prominent filmmakers on either side of the debate. In addition, the impact of digital conversion on film exhibition, projectionists, and independent theatres will be examined closely. Particular focus will be on the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and its central facility in downtown Toronto, the TIFF Bell Lightbox, and its cinemas. Little scholarly research has been conducted pertaining to TIFF and its response to the digital revolution, which is a striking omission considering that TIFF is one of the largest, most prominent film festivals and cultural organizations in the world. As such, focus on the significance of TIFF’s emerging status as a modern-day cinematheque or art house in its acquisition and exhibition of celluloid films as well as digital is of particular interest. TIFF serves as an important example of how theatres can remedy the divide between celluloid and digital film exhibition through continued use of film projectors. Contextualized within TIFF’s dedication to protecting the medium for the preservation of film history and tradition for future generations, this research paper will analyze how 35mm film reels and projectors are becoming objects of nostalgia and artistic value due to their rarity and the intensifying dominancy of digital media. In spite of recent widespread conversion to digital projection in movie theatres, celluloid film will not become obsolete in the process, but persist as a medium of nostalgia and exhibition. <em>&nbsp;Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Commercial actors have high social standing and a privileged relationship with the social platforms used to disseminate much of commercial speech. In their pursuit of direct relationships with consumers, unmediated by publishers and free of the distrust of advertisement that has often characterized consumer-marketer relations, brands have cultivated content marketing practices based on serving consumer interests. Access to analytical tools allows companies to evaluate the success of content, eventually creating an environment in which most companies feel comfortable taking political stands in a way they did not before the widespread adoption of social media. Closer examination of political speech by commercial entities reveals strategies of communication that undermine avenues for public exchange and short-circuit non-market means of protest. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Through case studies of four different websites, this thesis looks at the ways people are using specific web 2.0 tools to show that rather than being either a revolutionary or refuedalized technology, web 2.0 is a fluid place, where action and distraction occur on a continuum of commoditization and cultural creation. This tangled web challenges propaganda models of communication because it helps turn the measure of public opinion from a push process to a pull process. Under this new paradigm, public reason is found in the interactions between websites and online and offline life, equally as much as it is found within the dialogue on individual sites. And though these tools provide a voice for the elite to assert their dominance, they also result in a decline of deference to experts, and new ways for citizens to add their voices to public conversation. <em>Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Social structure; Mass communications Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Given Canada's extraordinary demographic heterogeneity, the mechanisms in place to encourage the development of networks between and among ethnic communities are increasingly important for supporting social solidarity in the broader population (Putnam, 2006). Canada's Broadcasting Act, §3(1)(d)(iii) (1991) and related policies which the Act initiates, including the Ethnic Broadcasting Policy, provide a policy framework for the creation and distribution of culturally and linguistically diverse content" to Canadian audiences, demonstrating official support for the potential social benefits associated with the national availability of ethnic media. By developing culturally and linguistically diverse content aligned with the demographic realities of the Canadian population within a supportive policy environment, ethnic media can provide, an important platform for sharing information and ideas across vast geographic or sociocultural divides, as well as a venue for fostering community building, civic involvement and an active dialogue amongst Canadians of all backgrounds. This research seeks to explore and develop theoretical linkages between the existing policy framework governing ethnic broadcasting in Canada, the broadcasting sector's methods of compliance with existing regulation, and the development of social capital. <em>broadcasting policy; Canada; ethnic broadcasting; ethnic media; multiculturalism; OMNI Television Group; social capital; state governance.

For Melies, motion pictures allowed the technical production of deception and illusion for his "trick" films, and in popular mythology, frightened spectators fled an exhibition of Auguste and Louis Lumiere's L'Arrivee d'un train en gare de la Ciotat (1895) fearing the imminent arrival of the train at the theatre itself. While this latter story has been roundly discredited, it holds an important place in cinematic lore. In the various efforts of documentary filmmakers to negate the idea of objective truth, whether through direct cinema/cinema verite, the use of reflexive gestures, or subjective positioning, there is a sense of an imminent threat of deception in film's mediation of truth. As Tom Gunning (2004) and Rachel O. Moore (2000) have recently argued, even critical explorations of cinema, quite as much as filmmaking practices themselves, have held the medium in deep suspicion. In the screen theories derived from Lacan and Althusser that dominated 1970s film studies we see film scholars move towards a conception of film that sees deception and trickery - otherwise called "ideological mystification" - as an innate feature of the cinematic apparatus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite, or perhaps because of, these ongoing concerns, there seems to be a civic-mindedness among critics, theoreticians, filmmakers, and film-watchers alike which holds that film should be able to present at least some verifiable truths and that filmmaking should still be able to provide a reliable document. However, since film is always a mediation of something else, the direct path to these truths - as the debates about documentary filmmaking and realism have shown - will always be complex, and, indeed, contingent upon the culture in which they find purchase. What is at stake then, is not so much what is real and what is not, but the conditions under which verisimilitude - the experience of reality - can be taken to occur and be produced. This paper is about some of the pleasures to be found in watching a cinematic depiction of theft. Theft is something we do not ordinarily see. In cinematic depictions of theft we are shown something that occurs underneath the surface of our everyday reality. Just as much as cinema is deceptive, therefore, so too can it penetrate and explore deceptive phenomena. <em>Caper films; Fraud in motion pictures; Deception in motion pictures; Theft in motion pictures </em></p> </td>

This 'movement of movements' is uniquely positioned to battle the forces of global capital from its own 'fluid' territory, however, while protesters converge on the streets, ostensibly under the same collective identifier---anti-globalization---their interests are instead diverse, their goals multifaceted and their identities fluid, underscoring the complexity when attempting to represent this movement in mass media. Media's increasing concentration and orientation as a profit driven business poses particular challenges to a movement opposing capitalism. Media, as a site of resistance, a public sphere and as a tool of social change, is approached as a hegemonic and ideological apparatus that reflexively defends the status quo and chastises would-be challengers. By examining how this movement is subordinated through a frame analysis of media content, this thesis demonstrates one intervention into the role of media in the practice of dissent, and concludes that media's tendency to marginalize protesters suggests the need to reorient movement targets and focus on shifting policy and changing the state. <em>Communication and the arts; Florida; Washington; Mass media Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

The aggressive style of discourse so prevalent in online discussion has been cited as a significant barrier to the deliberative and open discussion necessary for a effective public sphere. This paper focuses on web-based discussion in a online policy consultation called the Canadian Foreign Policy Dialogue, and examines specific discourse features to evaluate whether the moderated online policy discussion was civil, and whether that civility promoted meaningful interaction among citizens, and between citizens and government. The study results revealed that citizen participants in the dialogue were successful at developing, maintaining, and enforcing norms of civil discourse, and that these norms helped to promote understanding, tolerance, and consensus-building. The study also cautions that civil dialogue alone cannot ensure effective communication between governments and citizens. <em>Political participation;&nbsp; Computer networks; Civil society; Internet; Political aspects; Democracy Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Contrary to the aspirations of roboticists, the average person has greeted these autonomous machines with skepticism and anxiety rather than futurist enthusiasm. This paper proposes that these tumultuous early human-robot interactions can be eased by acknowledging an unsung ancestor of these machines: the toy. Common dolls and action figures share the caricatured form and synthetic components of robots yet have routinely been embraced as cherished objects and companions. A critical analysis of toys and the general concept of play consequently offers a template to improve the design and ease the acceptance of these intimidating new automata. This analysis begins with an historical review of how icons of the human form have been conceived of in ancient ritual, modern childhood, and science fiction. The latter half of the paper advocates an embrace of the latent toy-like qualities of robots in order to better human-robot interaction using methods drawn from the fields of cultural anthropology and play theory. These methods are grounded by the author's own practical experiences operating the NAO robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics in a research setting. The robot-as-toy metaphor forwarded throughout this paper is tentatively offered as an alternative perspective to the engineering-based solutions that often dominate the field of robotics. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

The imminantization of capital in the "digital economy" collapses traditional notions of space-time and in the shift from national culture to biopolitically charged studentship there is a shift away from a labour power that produces capital to a new type of human capital; I argue against sociologists of education and in favour of the concept of thought as alienation. <em>biopolitics; cultural studies; digital economy; higher education; national culture; neoliberal governmentality; university; urbanization Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

It has to regain a sense of everyday reality and it has to rendertruthfully an important slice of recent history which has been horribly falsified. A blast of Neorealism is practically a moral obligation for our cinema at this time in its history."- Eugenia Voda, film critic, 1995. Romanian film critic Eugenia Voda has made this nearly prophetic statement only five years after the end of Romania's communist regime. Yet more than prophetic, her remark was an appeal to filmmakers, and their conscious as well as conscientious sense of truth. Although more than ten years have passed since, her words often resonate in close association with recent Romanian films and their honest representation of social reality, unique in the history of Romanian cinema. But to what extent is recent Romanian cinema a national cinema? Given the Western history of analysis of foreign cinematic productions, any current examination of non-Western films within a Western theoretical context must be carried out in relation to the prior theoretical developments, debates, and conclusions within the national cinema framework. Benedict Anderson's concept of the "imagined community' resides as foundation in the process of defining what is national (Anderson, 1983). When speaking of nationalist media, Anderson claims that while a nation is portrayed as a community, it is only an imagined one. Members of a nation do not all know each other, "yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion" (Anderson, 1983, p.6). From this perspective, cinema's popularity and ease of distribution has led to films becoming part of mass communications, and thus it can easily play a role in disseminating both national and nationalist ideals. persisted as a theoretical framework during the development and establishment of film studies as a Western academic discipline. <em>Motion pictures; Romania; Realism in motion pictures Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

This thesis is a meditation on the notion of art or aesthetics as technological, arguing that art or aesthetics in its highest aspect can foment revolution or transformation within oneself, or in the material world. The power of art to invoke change, I define as magic, a means of effectuation that exists outside of the confines of a materialist or scientistic imaginary. Such a mode of effectuation is also linguistic, and connected with meaning. These ideas find their inspiration primarily in the works of Heidegger, Deleuze, Lacan, Kristeva, Schelling, and Slattery.

In particular, representations of domestic workers and farm workers are the focus of analysis. This analysis is helpful in revealing the extent to which Canadian nation-state interests, including neo-liberalism and nationalist multicultural sentiment, are articulated within the discourses of the mainstream newsprint media. Emphasized is how neo-liberalism operates within a nation-state where the dominant discourse of multiculturalism is predominant. Overall this research demonstrates that the acceptance of migrant workers is conditional. This type of acceptance is characterized by their limited existence as economic participants in the Canadian economy, and their especially oppressed experiences as social and political participants. Overall this research demonstrates that within the mass media, as one component in the larger discourses of neo-liberal capitalism and multicultural tolerance, the subjectivity and agency of migrant workers goes hugely unrecognized. <em>Canada; Canadian media representations; identity; migrant workers; multiculturalism; neoliberalism; neoliberal capitalism; newsprint media; tolerance.

Seven typefaces were designed to show shouted, whispered, quick, slow, tense, relaxed, and trembling ways of speaking respectively. A series of three focus groups with deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing participants were held to evaluate the usefulness of these typefaces and, based on the results of a questionnaire and group discussion, alterations were made to the designs after each focus group.

Western Views Of New China's Graphic Design 1998-2008</strong><br> Catherine Ishino (2009); Supervised by Michael Prokopow</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper:</strong> This paper seeks to describe the Western visual hegemonic discourse surrounding the graphic design of what is now called 'the New China' in the two decades prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and the current global economic crisis. I will make the case before 2008 and the Peoples Republic of China's (PRC) triumphant Olympic Games, China's design was of being seen as a 'subaltern visual object.' from the perspective of the Western design profession. The latter's stance lags far behind the prevailing counter-hegemonic narratives of the long-standing postcolonialists' theories and theorists of the 1970s - 1980s. So in taking up the postcolonialists' counter-hegemonic narratives, I contend the Western designers' narrative of China was envisaged when the 'Occidental' hemisphere, perceived itself as reigning supreme over the 'Oriental' hemisphere, at a time when Euro-American capitalism was at its apex during the 19th and 20th centuries. The latter deemed their industrial and information revolutionp as justifiable affirmations of their international imperialistic power. The Westernized hegemonic capitalism and image-driven consumer ethos became globally pervasive. However, following the visual tour de force of the 2008 Olympics and the West's dramatic economic instability in late 2008, I believe the subordinate view of the New Chinese graphic design, held by the West, merits and requires a second look. <em>Graphic arts; China; Commercial art; China; Visual communication; China </em></p> </td>

Simply put, the Abu Ghraib photos are purposeful compositions that highlight victory over the enemy Other in war. The photos illustrate sexual and racial violence, founded upon postcolonial narratives, but this is only a starting point for their significance. I address how meaning is made for the U.S. military personnel who took photographs of naked Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib, by looking backward to soldiers’ photography from WWI and II, and by considering soldiers’ online sharing of photographs in the present, examining roughly fifty photos total. The relationships between photographic materiality, emotional and gestural communication, and the production of cultural memory, disseminated via networked circulation, all shape how soldiers’ wartime photographs come to be regarded. Employing an interdisciplinary approach, this research draws upon war photography; visual culture and communication; sociology of groups and ritual; sociology of emotion; combat histories; memory studies; and online photo sharing practices. In so considering, the Abu Ghraib photos are not unique, and are instead grouped within the greater concept of the “war trophy.” I expand on this concept by defining “war trophy photography” as the entwined practices of war photography and trophy collection, rooted in ritual and group solidification. Staged to depict the violent conquering of the enemy, I argue that war trophy photography recognizes war efforts through the construction of a visual record, one that reproduces relations of dominance and submission. I call this representation “commemorative violence,” a central concept I develop to define the war trophy photograph. In addition to grounding the Abu Ghraib photos historically, I review their visual semiotic, cultural significance, such as with the “Doing a Lynndie” meme, which features civilians gesturing in thumbs-up toward a downtrodden individual, copying the same gesture as often used in the images from Abu Ghraib, and the now defunct site “Now That’s Fucked Up,” which briefly allowed soldiers in 2005 to trade gruesome war trophy pictures for pornography. The conclusion reflects on war trophy photography with the topical consideration of drones, ultimately suggesting that drone warfare photos are expressionless because of the overt absence of people. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Current diagnostic trends are contextualized within the history of medicine, from Ancient Greece to the present, including the development of imaging. Since the 1970s, advanced medical imaging technologies (e.g., ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) have become the diagnostic norm in Western medicine. The rapidity of this shift, which renders the human body as flattened data, can outstrip considerations of the implications of applying such technologies to living patients. Focusing on older patients, who may be less technologically savvy than younger patients or medical professionals, the field research begins with semi-structured interviews of patients over age sixty-five, exploring their encounters with medical imaging equipment and professionals. This data is interrogated qualitatively using Foucauldian discourse analysis drawing on Andrea Doucet’s model of slow scholarship, and informed by Arthur Frank’s notion of letting stories breathe; themes were allowed to surface from the patients’ narratives, rather than imposed by the researcher. Information emerging from the data considers patients’ emotions, unexpected physical sensations, communicative strategies and rationalizations, as well as Foucauldian allusions to power. Observational research was also conducted during encounters between physicians and simulated patients in the presence of medical images; these encounters were followed by reflective exit interviews. Research indicates that although physicians are increasingly trained in patient-centred communication, it is not always optimally practised. Physicians are sometimes more comfortable with the medical discourse of disease than with the emotional, metaphoric language of the patient’s illness experience. Since the development of modern Western medicine in Europe of the late 1700s, physicians have been trained to seek pathology, with the increasing aid of medical technologies, rather than listening to their patients. For older patients, who may experience multiple co-morbidities, the lack of communication around advanced medical technologies can increase their sense of vulnerability and anxiety. The dissertation concludes with recommendations for both patients and practitioners to improve communication in the medical context. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Playboy are the primary materials used to identify representational tactics unique to, and common between, pornography and fashion magazines. Multiple methods are used to analyze and engage with the visual conventions found in examples of each genre's source materials. Claims of diffusion between the genres are assessed through quantitative content analysis, which is in turn examined through semiotics, and ultimately interpreted through artistic practice. This is in order to gain general insight into how desire and meaning are transmitted through the photographic imagery popularized by each genre. The purpose of this study is to illuminate how sexualized images are reproduced and manipulated to stimulate, satiate, and direct desire for divergent commercial purposes. <em>Visual communication; Philosophy; Visual sociology; Consumption (Economics); Social aspects; Fashion; Social aspects; Pornography; Social aspects; Advertising; Social aspects </em></p> </td>

This division continues today through the Mexican ruling class' appropriation of advertising. Having worked in Mexican communications for over eighteen years, I am of the opinion that its ruling class, made up of a few families of European descent, have been able to maintain their power and money through the appropriation of communication. I am interested in the functions and systems in place that allow this to propagate and how meaning is being reproduced unperceived by the audience. My thesis question asks, What are the visual representations of the power relationships in Mexico's political economy as reflected through the appropriation of advertising? To answer this question, I perform a semiotic analysis of branded advertising messages created by the companies Bimbo, Palacio de Hierro and FEMSA, owned by the Mexican ruling families Servitje, Bailleres and Garza respectively. Each television commercial is examined for signs, cultural codes, gestures, gaze and word tracks. These signs are decoded, and the conclusion is expressed through "An Exhibition of Visual Messaging", designed to inform the Mexican public of how messages are constructed and received, empowering the viewer to interpret and challenge the meaning behind the communications they are receiving through the metamedia. <em>Semiotic analysis; advertising; Mexico; Visual Culture Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

This dissertation posits intellectual disability as a modernist subject category characterized by un-belonging and a presumed lack of normative expression. The author takes a hesitant, interpretive, and phenomenological approach to confronting the question of what it means to re/make intellectual disability as presence and process rather than as problem. The researcher engages with intellectual disability by introducing expressive writing as method under a feminist post structuralist framework of exploratory, relational ethics. In doing so, this project introduces the concepts of wonderment and triple-labelling to the fields of cultural studies and critical disability studies. This work advocates for a reorientation toward meaning-making and research-based engagement with intellectual disability as cultural, contextual, and relational phenomenon that remains unsettled as it situates researchers at a perceived limit of knowledge. This dissertation privileges process over resolution. The writing launches from an affect-laden epistemology of wonderment, and thus struggles to resolve its own ethical and methodological uncertainty as it attempts to center intellectual disability without (completely)privileging normative ways of un/knowing. This approach allows that the body is implicated in uncertain discursive processes that re-construct and circulate meanings about the body, the self,and the Other. Then, relying on Foucault’s conceptions of power and knowledge and Snyder and Mitchell's cultural location of disability framework, the study describes Western cultural memory: processes of mind/body splitting and subject-category building traceable through esoteric pre-modernity, eugenic modernity, and the post-identity politics of Davis’s dismodernity. A discussion of research ethics follows, which challenges rational methodological conceptions of intellectual disability that rely on preconceived notions of vulnerability. Before describing expressive writing as a primary research method, the author also makes a case for engaging with triple-labeled people (those labeled disabled, vulnerable, and incompetent) by writing in-relation-to, privileging silence and absence over “giving voice,” engaging in unfamiliarity and untranslatability, and attending to “the space between” the self and the Other.This writing uses reflexive vignettes and critical analysis to lead readers toward the researcher’s final phenomenological reflections on experiences with triple-labeled people writing in a Toronto day program. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

It uses two political events -- the People Power II demonstration in Manila, Philippines in 2001, and the national election in Kenya in 2002 -- as case studies to test a framework that draws from articulation theory and actor-network theory, informed by a history of development communication. People in developing countries have been fast adopters of cell phone technology. Popular media reports describe people's use of the cell phone as an instrument for the organization of potent political resistance in the digital age. The paper strives to ground assumptions of the "power of texting" in a robust examination of the factors that lead to the formation of social groups. The thesis argues that cell phone network coverage maps are useful tools in the study of social and cultural phenomenon. These maps may be read as zones of political power, enabling those with access to the technology to promote their political agenda, while those without access may be disadvantaged. <em>Political participation; Philippines; Kenya; Cell phones; Power (Social sciences); Text messages.

Thinking through movement allows for consideration of the temporal presence and experience of artworks, and enables an approach to art that crosses aesthetic boundaries. This study is carried out through close hermeneutic studies of three distinct artworks: Michael Snow's video gallery installation That/Cela/Dat (2000), Marie Menken's 16mm film Arabesque for Kenneth Anger (1958 – 1961), and Richard Serra's steel sculpture Double Torqued Ellipse (1997). Movement in these artworks does not appear merely as change over time or change of place, but rather as something that is coherent and consistent with itself but does not conclude itself, something that is in continual flux but does not try to achieve an end point, and something that holds forth and protects potent encounters with otherness. Movement, grasped in this way, is irreducible, generative, and tensile. The particular approach to this study is drawn from Samuel Mallin's phenomenological method of Body Hermeneutics. The method continues Heidegger's focus on singular artworks, and accepts that any particularly strong work of art is as worthy of careful study as any noteworthy work of philosophy or theory. Furthermore, drawing on Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, the method works from a conception of human consciousness that includes our affective, moving-body, perceptual, as well as cognitive integrations with the world. All four of these distinct, yet overlapping, regions of consciousness are embodied, and thus require physical situatedness with the phenomena to be described. Hence, the phenomenological descriptions in the dissertation are developed from writing done in the presence of the artworks, and the themes of movement are drawn from the phenomena shown by the artworks themselves. Through its embodied approach, and by working itself out through themes of movement encountered in three distinct works of art, Made from Movement contributes insights into topics of temporality, technology, language, femininity, perception, cinema, and art. In addition to offering critical writing on artworks by Snow, Menken, and Serra, the three hermeneutic studies also contribute philosophical reflection on the work of Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Irigaray, and Wittgenstein, among others. <em>Aesthetics of Movement; Hermeneutics; Art; Philosophy. </em></p> </td>

This is achieved in four parts: two on history and theory, and two case studies. The theoretical chapters have two main foci: the first is by finding value in videogames as meaningful cultural artifacts that play a role in the ongoing maintenance of the state and civil society. This is achieved through a literature review and discussion of the contemporary theoretical parameters of the public sphere, which draws heavily on the work of Habermas (1991), Warner (2002) and Drache (2008). In the second chapter this discussion is located inside the field of game studies, drawing heavily on the work of Bogost (2007), whose theoretical frameworks about the persuasive potential of videogames is investigated through their unique status as computational objects. The two second chapters each conduct a political economy through commodification, spatialization and structuration (Mosco, 2009) on the development of videogames who have a direct link with state intervention: The United States Army recruitment videogame America's Army (which was funded entirely by the Pentagon) and the Toronto developed iOS videogame Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, which was the recipient of a small-scale cultural industry grant from the provincially owned Ontario Media Development Corporation. <em>America’s Army (video game); Canada; cultural artifacts; game studies; government; political economy; public sphere; state intervention; Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP (video game); Toronto; United States; video games.

Steam creates and exercises processes and techniques such as monopolization and enclosure over creative products, online labour, and exchange among game designers. Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding framework places communication at the centre of the political economy, here of digital commodities distributed and produced by online platforms like Steam. James Gibson’s affordance theory allows the market Steam’s owners create for its users to be cast in terms of visuality and interaction design. These theories are largely neglected in the existing literature in game studies, platform studies, and political economy, but they allow intervention in an ongoing debate concerning the ontological status of work and play as distinct, separate human activities by offering a specific focus on the political economy of visual or algorithmic communication. Three case studies then analyze Steam as a site where the slippage between game-play and work is constant and deepening. The first isolates three sales promotions on Steam as forms of work disguised as online shopping. The second is a discourse analysis of a crisis within the community of mod creators for the game Skyrim, triggered by changes implemented on Steam. The third case study critiques Valve Corporation’s positioning of Steam as a new space to extract value from play by demonstrating historical continuity with consumer monopolies. A concluding discussion argues Steam is a platform that evolves to meet distinct crises and problems in the production and circulation of its digital commodities as contradictions arise. Ultimately, Steam shows how the cycle of capital accumulation encourages monopolization and centralization. <em>political economy; digital labour; Steam; platforms; play; distribution; games Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Together, along with the ideologies users come online with, Shaadi.com forms a quality single ideal, outlining standards of desirability, which are markers of authentic Indian-ness. The standards of desirability are cues of attractiveness around gender, sexuality, race, and class, aiding users' representations and how they read the representations of attractive profiles in the limited space of self-disclosure.

Through this critique, I will illustrate how highly valued cultural objects like the photographic print and the family album have been replaced by hypermediated transactions of images stored online via social networking websites. Specifically, I will explore why our contemporary society looks back to its past, and at the same time yearn for the future. Smart-phone developers tap into the niche market of this nostalgic trend and created, for example, the Hipstamatic application to give us images that capture moments that look unique, old, and most importantly, one-of-a-kind. The nostalgic qualities associated with analogue snapshot photography-aged prints, exposure flaws, soft focus, and light leaks-are mimicked by contemporary digital images, creating the illusion of historical uniqueness.

Though it has been suggested that we have entered a post-national era defined by hyper-mobility and global interconnectivity, it is argued here that there is an ongoing need to think critically about locality, specifically through the concept of the site to ground negotiations of identity, political solidarity, and citizenship. The site is not only defined geographically but exists as the result and embodiment of particular historical, socio-political, and economic conditions. With this as a backdrop, I suggest that critical artistic practices function as experiments in the continued re-imagination and reclamation of the Polish site, and argue that media art is an important tool in processes of self-enfranchisement. I frame these practices through a theoretical exploration of media art and media theory, and through a Polish archaeology of experimentation that includes the Constructivists of the 1920s-1930s, the Workshop of the Film Form in the 1970s, the public performances of the 1980s, and the neo-expressionism of the 1990s. I then turn to the work of nine contemporary artists (Rafał Jakubowicz, Aleksandra Polisiewicz, Hubert Czerepok, Grzegorz Rogala, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Aleksandra Wasilkowska, Dominik Lejman, Izabella Gustowska, and Piotr Wyrzykowski) as examples of critical and experimental media art practice, and suggest that their work can be interpreted as a negotiation of one of three aspects—or ecologies—of the Polish site: the past, democracy, and mediation. I propose that such artistic practices intervene in these ecologies by enabling the pluralization of history and memory, the emergence of public spaces of appearance and communication, and the demystification of the processes of mediation of life and self. I propose therefore that critical media art practices can be understood as site-specific experiments within the ecologies of site and act as provocations or challenges to current political and economic ideologies and hegemonies. In this way they provide a particular opportunity for re-becoming political, critical, and engaged with the broader issues that define and shape the Polish site of this particular period. <em>Art history; East European Studies; Social sciences; Communication and the arts; Artistic practice; Media art; Poland Media and Culture;Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Both are influenced by technological practices that serve to organize sound in space, an organization that is both material and historical in nature. Describing this relationship requires a conceptual vocabulary sensitive to the theoretical complexities of technology, space and experience, and how they implicate social relations at every level of human aurality. To this end, this dissertation develops the concept of soundspace as a means of exploring and analyzing the spatial relations of sound and aurality. It proposes this concept in place of the generally accepted acoustic ecology model of the soundscape, arguing that the latter is problematic in terms of its understanding of the historical diversity and cultural heterogeneity of aural space, and that its conceptual formulation is too narrow for an adequate understanding of technologically mediated aural space. The idea of soundspace rejects the traditional and problematic dichotomies the soundscape depends on, such as divisions between nature and culture, human and technological, urban and rural, and music and noise. At its core the concept of soundspace proposes that all sound is culturally resonant, that sound is socially inflected by the spatial organization that inevitably frames its production, presence and experience. The notion of soundspace is elaborated in terms of three overlapping and interlocking technological registers, environmental, architectural and electronic, which together provide a renewed conceptual framework for analyzing the relationship between technology, space and aural experience. <em>Fine arts; Music; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Aurality; Sound; Spatial organization Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

But what glorious promises they make" (9)1 In large part this text is dedicated to exploring these very promises, not so much to celebrate the grandeur and bombast of the film poster but to understand the complex processes of interaction that exist between a film, its posters, and their audiences. Of course, the promises that Kehr is referring to are the more or less straightforward ones posters make when they implicitly offer us the chance at experiencing the films they promote as glamorous, adventurous, terrifying, and seductive. In this respect, film posters, like all forms of advertising, seek to create audiences by attaching a fixed social identity to a product that is by its nature polysemic, representing too many things to too many people to be completely represented by any single combination of text and image. Unlike most consumer products however, films are ephemeral in nature, disappearing from view the minute they have been consumed, and like dreams they are only half-remembered by those who have consumed them. Consequently, the relationship between the film and its poster is not quite the same as the relationship between a tangible consumer product and the advertising imagery that sells it. The intangibility of films, in that they are seen only temporarily in the dark and quiet confines of the theatre and our living rooms, make them especially in need of a body, a corporeal vehicle with which they can circulate in the world. In a consumerist culture such as ours, where social relations are structured through the fetishization of commodities, ephemeral products such as films leave consumers needing a tangible emblem, either because they crave owning a piece of what they love or simply to see for themselves whether or not a film is in fact "my kind of movie." <em>Alfred Hitchcock; audience reception; cinema; consumer culture; cultural studies; David Kehr; DVD; film poster; film publicity; Hollywood; movie poster; semiotics; social identity; Vertigo (movie).

This paper is not primarily concerned with the actual scope of the loss of privacy, although it is based on the assumption that recent online developments are harbingers of the near total erosion of privacy. The premise of this paper is the curious paradox of living in a society that had had, until September 11, 2001, unprecedented levels of privacy protection, while at the same time undergoing rapid devaluation of privacy rights, seemingly voluntarily sacrificed by citizens/ consumers in aid of market advantages through globalized networks. <em>body politics; Canada; Canadian law; community; Hannah Arendt; Jürgen Habermas; privacy; public sphere; social network theory; surveillance.

Rather than a popular notion of Cartesian dualism, digital code conveys the monistic philosophy of Leibniz. Computer circuitry reflects this logic, creating a digital text based on movement and instability rather than the definitiveness of text that Western society has been accustomed to. This technology was intended to serve humanity as a reasoning tool. As an android, it is meant in some ways to replace the human mind. However, where humans find meaning through analog experiences, computers and the code they operate with are digital, meaning they cannot approach what we might define as actual thought. Based on the prototype of the human brain, even the most sophisticated digital technologies can at best mimic human activities.

This new popular culture legitimatizes sex workers in a growing services industry and carries important de-stigmatizing messages about sex workers, who continue to be among the most stigmatized of women workers in the U.S. These new representations challenge stereotypical portrayals of sex workers – as immoral criminals or exploited victims – that support conservative and patriarchal ideologies. Drawing upon feminist theories of sex work, labour theory, and feminist media studies methodology for exploring the nexus of gender, sexuality, and popular culture, this dissertation examines feature films, TV series, and TV and online documentaries that depict five sex work occupations – erotic dancers, massage parlour workers, webcam models, call girls, and sex surrogates – to illustrate the new figure of the sex worker as entrepreneur and care worker under neoliberal capitalism. By emphasizing sex workers’ agency to choose their work, dignifying their skills, underscoring sex work as a means of economic mobility, and highlighting the positive contributions sex workers make to their clients’ lives, these popular culture representations challenge the anti-sex work position espoused by conservative patriarchal ideology and prohibitionist feminists. Some of these new representations, however, intertwine with a neoliberal post-feminist sensibility that frames empowerment as realizable through individualism and the market alone, rather than in collective ways, and pose few concrete solutions to the challenges faced by sex workers today, namely criminalization. Even so, this dissertation argues that these emerging twenty-first century representations of the sex worker as entrepreneur and care worker are progressive and mark a growing social tolerance for the idea that, for some women, sex work is legitimate work. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

It could be expected that this principle might be grounded in, and thus reinforce a mutually respectful, if not cooperative relationship between the government and the organizations claiming to represent the sector. In practice, Canadian public policy-making addressing the arts has not always corresponded with these expectations. Between 1963 and 1972, in particular, public support was used to direct the activities of independent or semi-autonomous organizations concerned with the arts in Canada, and to advance public policy goals that at best indirectly related to the well-being of the Canadian arts sector.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Between 1963 and 1972, federal interventions in the Canadian arts sector fundamentally changed. One aspect of this change is the evolution of the federal government's relationship to other prominent organizations active in the arts sector. Two of these leading groups are the Canada Council and the Canadian Conference of the Arts. The Canada Council was created in 1957 as a semi-autonomous federal agency to support the arts and letters through the interest on a public endowment. The Canadian Conference of the Arts (founded as the Canadian Arts Council) dates back to 1945 and is a voluntary advocacy agency representing arts groups across Canada. By the mid-1960s, the majority of both organizations' revenues were supplied through annual federal grants that were often tied to implicit or explicit conditions or directives regarding their use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This study examines the evolution of the objectives and behaviour of the Canada Council and the Canadian Conference of the Arts in the context of changing federal government goals and practices between 1963 and 1972, and seeks to assess the extent to which political goals intruded upon the operations and objective-setting of these organizations. Records of the Council's and the Conference's operations indicate that their operations and program were effectively re-shaped and re-oriented by federal intervention during the 1960s and early 1970s. <em>Canadian history; Art history; Political science; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Arts advocacy; Federal government; Finance; Policies Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> The renovation of the project of the city critiques the utopian character of the modern city project in order to reconfigure our capacity to creatively imagine different possibilities of what ought to be in relation to the alienating theoretical and historical conditions of modernity. Critique is focused on the technological foundation of the modern project that narrowly co-determines thinking and making as an instrumental calculus of production. While technology has enabled us to dominate the material world and transform both human nature and the city it has also resulted in our alienating loss of contact with reality and diminished the possibility of imagining reconciliation of the city with "life as it is." Renovation strives to recover the creative function of possibility within the city project through the dialogical examination of two 1920s avant-garde experimental city projects: Dziga Vertov's "Man With The Movie Camera" and André Breton's Nadja. Renovation is grounded in a theoretical and historical genealogy of the modern city project, from Plato's Republic through Renaissance ideal cities to the critical dissolution of traditional forms and meanings of architecture and the city within the emerging conditions of modernity. Simultaneously, the genealogy also recovers forgotten meanings and configurations of the project upon the anamnesis of the limits of knowledge, the measure of life, ideas of space, and the visibility of art. Delimiting the modern utopian imperative, this other knowledge is a prologue to the dialogical articulation of the form and character of the renovated project through the detailed examination of Vertov and Breton's avant-garde projects. Reflecting fundamental contrasts within a persistent modern dialectic of imaginative consciousness between knowledge and affect, consciousness and the unconscious, representational picturing and imaginative vision, the juxtaposition of Vertov and Breton's projects articulates the renovated project upon the mediation of the modern gap between technological production and creation based in the recuperation of the dark, spurious origins of creative knowledge in Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" and the reconfiguration of a project in terms of the work of art in Heidegger's "The Origin of the Work of Art." <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Digital technologies involve a series of displacements from data storage and transfer to creating global networks. Going hand in hand with human mobilities technological displacement affects our lives and interactions deeply. Multimedia and digital overlaying of information and interconnectedness (mobile devices, tracking technologies, the internet...) make up our quotidian in various degrees, impelling us to be ‘present’ in time and places we actually are not. Technological displacement may be viewed as an extension of physical displacement of individuals and communities in that the need to reconcile, re-invent and innovatively market proximity becomes more and more an underlying theme of contemporary lives. Nowhere the reorientations of presence is more accentuated than ‘augmented space’, as described by Lev Manovich, “ a physical space overlaid with dynamically changing information, multimedia in form and localized for each user.”(219) It may be argued that our sense of reality is already ‘augmented’ by digital stimuli in many ways. Here I make the case that in an augmented or digitally enhanced environment we are displaced multiple times, or “multiplaced”. Augmentation is superimposing multimedia to real space, blurring the boundary between the real and the virtual, creating a heterogeneous space defined neither by the standards of the virtual nor the real but the coexistence and cooperation of both. Augmented reality functions on the principle of multiple displacements in that iv real space is not a backdrop to multimedia: it is indispensable to the overall embodied experience. I created The Coat Check in 2011 using motion tracking technologies (Intersense IS900), specialized cameras (Point Grey 360° Spherical Vision Camera), screens (FogScreen), software (Max/MSP), tools and applications (Snapdragon AR). The conceptualization of The Coat Check is based on an analogy between digital technologies and coat checks that are both storage, retrieval and displacement systems. The Coat Check also raises questions on identity and history as it refers to belonging, temporality, and mobility. This project is inspired by the work of Mona Hatoum and Kutluğ Ataman. Both artists’ installations focus on the dialectics of the interior and exterior, past and present, memory and amnesia. This research originates from questions of identity, mobility and memory and evolves towards an understanding of technological displacement. <em>augmented reality; augmented space; belonging; data storage; data transfer; history; global networks; identity; installation; memory; mobility; motion tracking technologies; technological displacement; temporality.

A Case Study Of Central European: Media Enterprises</strong><br> Monica Kohlenberg (2009); Supervised by Charles Davis</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper:</strong> During the transition from authoritarian regimes to democracy, media have changed along with the other components of social and economic life. They have evolved from propaganda vehicles to real business entities that are functioning in free markets. However, relations between the media, state, society, and market have led to the development of unique dynamics of media systems in the ex-communist countries. Among all media groups that have formed in the ex-communist space, there is one company that stands out. Central European Media Enterprises (CME) - a Bahamas-based American-owned company was the first to bring Western marketing and management styles, along with American programming. CME knew how to commercially exploit the market's underdeveloped potential and consumers' thirst for information and entertainment. This paper looks at CME mainly from a business perspective. It attempts to document and explain the company's strategies and decisions, and the way in which they were influenced by politics. The theoretical framework of the paper builds on the Splichal's concept of "political capitalism" and on Doyle's and Mosco's theories of media economics. The conclusion is that CME's financial success has been highly influenced - though not totally determined - by factors that have nothing to do with a normal, healthy business environment. <em>Mass media; History; 20th century; Mass media; Political aspects; Corporations; Europe; Central; Central Europe; Cultural policy Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Disney Infinity is a leading developer and marketer of this type of game. For this reason, it serves as a case study in the paper. The analytical framework of the paper is based on two theories that are extended to the realm of digital video games: Magaudda’s (2012) re-materialization and Olson’s (2004) environmental simulacra. This hybrid theoretical approach is intended to highlight the ways in which Disney Infinity’s “Toy Box” model reflects a mixed-reality extension of Disney’s cross-promotional initiatives. Disney Infinity’s effectiveness in commodifying play in both the material and virtual domains affords it all the advantages linked to environmental synergy. The paper explores the notions of synergy and the development of commercial supertexts within the context of digital game production. It was found that, in line with the work of Murray (2003) and Blevins (2004), Disney’s digital game development history has demonstrated that the firm is not omnipotent in its ability to leverage cross promotion. The study of Disney’s history shows an initial inability to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions due to digital convergence. Disney Infinity’s subsequent success as a mixed reality platform, rather than being inevitable, was probably the result of advantageous market conditions associated with the commercialization of the "Internet of Things" and the emergence of the “toys-to-life” model. <em>&nbsp;Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Essentially, editors of the news media determine which images captured by citizen journalists will be used, and they also decide the messages that they want to send to the public through framing and editing techniques. Previous research on editorial practice has identified various standards about newsworthiness that serve as selection criteria. However, there is a limited amount of research available on how UGC has changed the traditional journalism model. Through qualitative interviews with seven image editors, five news companies, The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CTV, Macleans, Rabble and The Toronto Star, this study sheds light on the editor's perceptions about citizen journalist videos and images in news content online. Three Canadian case examples are examined for their visual content analysis: the immigration ex-judge sex bribe case, the Vancouver police tasering of a Polish man, and Victoria police manhandling two young men at a nightclub. Through analysis of the interviews and case studies, this study finds that editors feel that UGC has not altered their traditional news standards. However, upon closer examination of news report cases, it does appear that UGC, which often consists of low quality videos with information entertainment content, has in fact affected the practices of quality journalism. The news media have adopted UGC content styles, which tend toward being more sensational, graphic, raw; these styles can make "hard news", which conveys investigative in-depth information, appear similar to "soft news", such as sensational infotainment. Notwithstanding that professional news organizations use public content in their news stories, they have not provided a platform of partnership to allow citizens to have a democratic voice through their media <em>broadcasting; CBC; CTV; democracy; internet; journalism; Macleans; media ethics; news media; online news sites; participatory journalism; photojournalism; Rabble; Toronto Star; user-generated content; video journalism.

A factor behind its popularity has been the nature of its research design that incorporates both media content and public opinion in a manner that yields an observable and empirically testable effect. Despite the model's importance, there has been little systematic evaluation of the underlying research design and, in particular, the role of media within the media/transfer of salience/public opinion equation. How media should be conceptualized within the research design has growing importance to the broader study of media effects due to the divergence of media sources and the erosion of mainstream media influence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The thesis addresses these issues by first conducting a meta-analysis that focuses on the research designs in agenda-setting research published in the last 25 years in major journals. The meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that media is often underconceptualized in research designs, and offers a new approach—the media-centric model—that addresses key weaknesses concerning the proximity of media to audience/respondents and other factor that undermine research design validity. The media-centric model was tested over a five-month period in the Waterloo region of Ontario. The model includes formulas for weighting of media content based on market research and other audience demographic data.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The study confirmed the presence of an agenda-setting effect, and also confirmed the importance of proximity of news content and, in particular, the importance of local news media coverage that is often overlooked in agenda-setting research. The presence of the agenda-setting effect was not significantly strengthened by the application of audience demographic data, but other factors from the model that enhanced proximity of content did indicate significant results, but were qualified by the nature of key news events. The results provide an important contribution to conceptualizing the role of media not only in agenda-setting research designs but also in other areas of study into primary media effects within the context of an expanding universe of mediated sources of news and information. <em>Communication and the arts; Agenda-setting; Media-centric model; Mass communications </em></p> </td>

In order to examine such relationships, this thesis engages a discourse analysis of three newspaper websites—Le Monde, Guardian Unlimited and the New York Times—and their coverage of the 2003 World Social Forum. The examination of three newspapers that have made the transition from print to online provides the ground for reassessment of the notion of the Internet as a democratic medium and shows there is a development of hybrid models that mix some of the characteristics of Internet-based communication with mass media communication.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The discourse analysis proceeds by analyzing the interplay between multiple levels of discourse—the textual level, the hypertextual level of internal and external links, and the interactive level of readers' participation. It is not only the discourses produced and the ideologies they carry that are analyzed, but also the ways in which those discourses embody the shifting relationships between journalists and audiences in the emerging online public sphere.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Not only do journalists define specific ideological representations of an event inscribed within the globalization/antiglobalization debate, they also use hyperlinks to both reinforce their discourses and to open them up to readers' scrutiny. As such, hypertext does not simply create multiple discourses, it also allows journalists to map the construction of their representations. The new relationships that are established with audiences through interactive debate point to the redefinition of the hierarchy between journalists and readers, with a gradation as to the extent to which readers can participate in building and interrogating the media representations. To conclude, this thesis suggests that the online public sphere could benefit from developing models of news communication that are more open to self-reflection about the representations they carry. <em>Mass media; Journalism; Communication and the arts </em></p> </td>

This project assesses the technocultural impact of software that automatically produces and dynamically adapts content to user input through a case study analysis of amazon.com and of the MediaWiki software package. It offers an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that borrows from communication studies (discourse analysis, medium theory, cultural studies of technology), from new media studies (software criticism) and from Actor-network theory and Felix Guattari's mixed semiotics. In so doing, the research defines a new methodological framework through which the question of semiotics and discourse can be analyzed thanks to an exploration of the technocultural conditions that create communicative possibilities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The analysis of amazon.com examines how the deployment of tools to track, shape and predict the cultural desires of users raises questions related to the imposition of specific modes of interpretation. In particular, I highlight the process through which user-produced meanings are incorporated within software-produced semiotic systems so as to embed cultural processes within a commercial imperative. While amazon.com is an instance of the commercial use of dynamic content production techniques on the Web, Wikipedia stands as a symbol of non-commercial knowledge production. The Wikipedia model is not only cultural, but also technical as mass collaborative knowledge production depends on a suite of software tools - the MediaWiki architecture - that enables new discursive practices. The Wikipedia model is the result of a set of articulations between technical and cultural processes, and the case study examines how this model is captured, modified and challenged by other websites using the same wiki architecture as Wikipedia. In particular, I examine how legal and technical processes on the Web appropriate discursive practices by capitalizing on user-produced content as a source of revenue. <em>Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Meaning-making; Semiotics; Technocultural; World Wide Web </em></p> </td>

Affect theory provides space for new ways of thinking of issues of fatness that are more encompassing, emphasizing the subjective experience of fat embodiment. It is the portrayal of the subjective experience of fat embodiment that makes the character, Dr. Mindy Lahiri, relatable to any individual affected by constant messages of current cultural standards of beauty— messages of ideal body weight and shape.

While on tour across Northern Ontario with the Cree language opera Pimooteewin: The Journey, I had the opportunity to share creative dance workshops with students living in remote locations. These students had limited access to dance education and most schools I visited had no integrated dance curriculum. I found this surprising since the inclusion of dance in Ontario public schools is a requirement. Dance was incorporated into the 1993 Common Curriculum and the 1998 Ontario Curriculum (Ministry of Education). Many teachers I spoke with while on tour mentioned they did not have access to high quality, free dance education materials, and did not feel comfortable teaching the subject. This experience drew me to develop an applied research project with Canada's National Ballet School's (CNBS) community outreach initiative, Sharing Dance. Unlike other online dance education organizations, such as the Council for Ontario Dance and Drama Educators (CODE) that works on a subscription model, Sharing Dance offers teachers easy access to dance education materials for free, potentially overcoming location and socioeconomic obstacles. <em>community-based action research; dance; dance education; online communities; participatory action research; Sharing Dance Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Since its establishment in 1938, CUP has brought campus newspapers from across the country together to share news and information as well as training with one another. From 1965 to 1991 CUP's policies stated that the major role of the student newspaper was to "act as an agent of social change." During this time CUP and its members took on an educative and active political role. Using CUP as a case study of a politically engaged press organization that saw its role as an active participant in the events it reported, this thesis illuminates the factors that can encourage a politically engaged press taking into consideration both theory and practice. This study examines the factors that made it possible for CUP to act as an agent of social change, how that role was interpreted, and the changes that resulted in the organization moving away from that role. <em>Canadian University Press; Journalism; Social change; Student newspapers and periodicals Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

The paper argues that, as a digital archive of streetstyle, The Sartorialist creates a convincing portrait of the mythic notion of self-invention through fashion by tying style to a variety of elements of the real. Through a distant reading of the archive and semiotic analysis of the images, the underlying structures of meaning-making on the site are revealed. Through a condensation of Nancy's theory of the image and Benjamin's conception of the wish in the dream, I argue that The Sartorialist both validates and highlights the ultimate limitations of the urban project of fashion and encourages a particular way of looking at the world. <em>blogging; everyday fashion; internet; online; self-invention; semiotics; street photography; subcultures; The Sartorialist; urban modernity.

She ardently believed that the exchange of ideas is a sometimes difficult but vital component of the creative process. It is because of this belief that she launched a magazine called the Little Review in 1914, which quickly established itself as the leading avantgarde magazine of its era. The Little Review was launched on the eve of the First World War, a period when widespread tensions manifested themselves in the arts as well as in political and social realms. It was therefore a time when Modernism - a revolutionary movement in the literary and visual arts that began in the late nineteenth century in response to traditional discourses of rationality and reached its apogee in First-World-War and post-war era- established itself with a broad array of new cultural expressions (Tew and Murray 11). Modernist experimentations were spearheaded by its avantgarde, a group of radical artists and writers representing an aggressively antagonistic spirit and revolting against the old systems of order and bourgeois institutions of art, as theorist Renato Poggioli (8) has described the historical avantgarde of the early twentieth century. As we shall see, the Little Review was an important member of a vanguard that helped create a cultural revolution by casting off, and inventing entirely new, literary and artistic conventions. <em>United States; Intellectual life; Aesthetics; Modern; Literature; History and criticism; Periodicals; Publishing; History </em></p> </td>

Initially developed by universities and the military, the speed at which the Internet was embraced by the general public during the mid-nineteen-nineties took governments and commercial interests by surprise. It allowed for a new form of discourse, where anyone could log-on and, at no additional cost, enter into conversations and debates with millions of other Internet users. This new medium for communicating information allowed individuals to overcome existing financial and spatial barriers and thereby engage in new forms of critical political dialogue. Internet communities have flourished and existing corporate media companies, experienced at producing and distributing content to audiences of consumers, have had to adapt to audiences that increasingly demand the right to create and distribute content themselves. Many governments, Canada included, have chosen to leave the Internet and its infrastructure largely unregulated, believing that existing legislation would suffice (Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commission. CRTC Won't Regulate the Internet). In contrast to traditional media enterprises already dominated by commercial interests, the Internet seemed to be a medium where commercial and public interests could successfully coexist, and where individuals could engage in critical dialogue, share ideas, and shape discourse and opinions offline as well as online.-from the introduction. <em>Technology and state; Online journalism; Social aspects; Electronic commerce; Internet and society Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Democracy and civil life, as the modem conceptualizations of those notions are typically understood, are bound to the idea that there exists not merely the functional devices of citizenry actively participating in the selection and implementation of governing, but that there also be a formidable, effective and widespread medium of one sort or another - or more than one - present. A product of society and culture, democracy cannot feasibly exist on an individual level, but only in a community and community, in tum, must be tethered together by commonly shared communicative threads (Van Benschoten 2000). Democracy, theoretically understood as it is based on the notion of citizens making informed decisions and choices about which manner and by which policies they themselves wish to be governed, must therefore thrive only on a framework which includes the allowance for a technology which provides for the effective dissemination of ideas to the citizens. In any other model, democracy would necessarily be undermined. There would exist a gap in the education in the abilities of different citizens to participate: those democrats fortunate enough to live in proximity to the major population centers, particularly those with real political relevance, would be more likely to directly have access to information about politicians and candidates, while citizens distanced from political centres by geographic barriers (agricultural workers would obviously be a predominant segment of just such a group) would similarly be distanced from the political process, bereft of any reliable means with which to equip themselves with the information they arguably need to make the educated electoral choices that are critical to the process of civic membership. This is particularly true, not only as it pertains to electing representatives - in which case candidates can often originate within regional proximity to voters, as is the case with Canadian members of parliament, and therefore will campaign regionally -- but additionally it is vital that citizens are kept abreast of the issues of the day and the performance of their elected officials once they are given power. Governmental responsibility is, if not a direct function of citizen proximity, then necessarily a function of citizen access to reliable channels of mass communication. <em>Democracy; Mass media; Political participation; Social capital (Sociology); Social networks; Internet </em></p> </td>

The concept album’s main focus is the implementation of catachresis – a traditionally linguistic or poetic trope which operates as an ‘abuse’ or ‘extension’ of metaphor – into popular music composition. I use Derrida’s (1982b) work on catachresis’ irruptions of meaning and Lakoff &amp; Johnson’s (1980; 1999) work on conceptual metaphor to argue that music is both experienced metaphorically and capable of engendering catachresis. Building on this, I adopt Chrzanowska-Kluczewska’s (2011) dissection of catachresis into three basic types. I then use Fauconnier &amp; Turner’s (2002) blending theory in order to ascertain the specifics of what may happen mentally when catachresis is experienced, and how composers may draw upon these mental processes when writing music. The final section of the essay describes my creative process based on these findings and the catachrestic compositional strategies I developed in order to write the music for Lyrebirds. <em>&nbsp;Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Using Facebook's own promotional and platform policy texts - many authored at a time when the company prepared for public trading - a promotional rhetoric inviting mobile users to actively partake in the site's 'engaging experiences' will be surveyed. The analyst adopts a view that engaging Facebook on mobile devices can be interpreted as an emerging form of hyper-mobile net work generating surplus value filtered towards particular interests (network 'nodes'). I argue that Facebook's source code can be likened to a worksite, albeit a highly decentralized one that, through mobile, bridge virtual influence to physical spaces. To meet such a task, end-users' mobile-specific technical rights will be discussed so far as they interface with other revenue-generating actors. Using a critical discourse analysis framework, this paper explores a grammar of interests portrayed at a key point in Facebook's company history, connecting Facebook's imagined mobile landscape to its initial public offering period. <em>Facebook; Facebook Mobile; mobile network society; network labour; property rights; social media; technical rights; Web 2.0.

A content analysis supports the model's predictions; the press placed greater emphasis on alleged crimes by the elected Haitian government than on the documented human rights crisis under the Canadian government-backed regime installed in the wake of the coup. Interviews with journalists and sources cast light on the news production processes, source strategies and media-source relationships that contributed to this pattern of coverage. Sources from the Haitian elite-led political movement seeking the elected government's ouster owned much of Haiti's private media, and benefited from US, Canadian and EU government financing and training. Interviews with Canadian and wire services journalists suggest that professional practices, organizational routines, and social barriers contributed to the access that these sources enjoyed in the Canadian media. <em>Journalism; Political science; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Haiti Media and Culture;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Non-fiction history, in documentary and docudrama form, has been a particularly important source of authoritative information on the Canadian past. The aim of Producing the Public Past is to document the general characteristics of this programming as it has evolved over the first fifty years of CBC television and specifically, to assess the role of its production environment in shaping these characteristics. The establishment of historical lineage has long been in the service of building nationalisms, and Canadian history programming has proven to be an important tool in supporting the nation-building aspect of the CBC mandate. Throughout the study period CBC officials consistently promoted it as proof that in this respect, the national public broadcaster was doing its job. Canadian history was also valuable in upholding the public service aspects of the CBC mandate. During the 1950s and 1960s especially, this was connected to the educational role of public broadcasting, and to the perception of public broadcasting as a provider of quality television. This changed as the provinces exercised their jurisdiction over educational broadcasting, as the CBC became more commercial, and as the Canadian broadcasting system moved towards an industrial model of production.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also evaluated in this study is the role of historians in CBC Canadian history programming. In the beginning this relatively small group of scholars was vital to the corporation as advocates of public broadcasting. As important was that they were advocates of an interpretation of the Canadian past largely shared by CBC producers. In general, these versions stressed national themes articulated from a centralist viewpoint, often with the (white, male) individual as the prime agent of past events. While Canadian historiography eventually expanded and diversified from this position, CBC histories did not, suggesting an ideology that in the end was separate from scholarly work. <em>Canadian history; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Canadian Broadcasting Centre; History programming; Television Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

This idea of development has been created from the ground up in interaction with indigenous communities of the country's Western highlands. The demographic nature of these communities has necessitated that CSD be formulated within the foundational frame of Maya cosmovision. This research attempts to understand the meaning of CSD as it is articulated at El Centro, and it asks what this idea may have to teach those who are more versed in mainstream "Western" theories of international development. CSD, it is argued, is an idea that is both old and new. It is not modern or "traditional" but rather transmodern. The incorporation of CSD logic into international development discourse would not be difficult where streams of thought related to cultural political economy are concerned. Development theory that is based in neoclassical economics, however, would require a major transformation if CSD were to be incorporated into its rubric. <em>Cultural anthropology; Social research; Latin American Studies; Social structure; Social sciences; Centro Pluricultural para la Democracia; Cosmovision; Culturally sustainable development; Guatemala; Maya Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Beginning with Antonin Artaud's conceptualization of a "theatre of cruelty", I propose to examine artistic embodiments of transgression and erotics in the works of performance artists such as Karen Finley and Vito Acconci, as well as in the virtual art of Char Davies. Transgression and erotics in popular culture will be explored through the performance style of Jim Morrison and The Doors. Using Nietzsche and Brown's discussions of the Apollonian and Dionysian conditions or states of artistic consciousness, I argue that a return to the senses or to the romanticist notion of the "deep interior" is required in order for the process of social healing and unification to begin. <em>Virtual reality in art; Art and technology; Interactive art; Theater; 20th century; Multimedia installations (Art); Psychological aspects; Performance art; Psychological aspects Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

The aims of the research are two-fold: to make a theoretical contibution to literature on organizations and technology by applying concepts of institutionalism and the structurational model of technology to a unique organizational form; and, to make a practical contribution to the nonprofit sector by improving knowledge of how networks of nonprofit organizations interact with information and communication technologies.</p> <p>The research process involved 13 interviews, 44 qualitative surveys and copious document and website analysis. The findings indicate that technology is not institutionalized uniformly within the network structures but instead comes to assume different roles within different parts of the networks. This leads to an extension of the structurational model of technology and also highlights the importance of flexible technologies that can be adapted to the variable circumstances of a single network structure. <em>Nonprofit organizations; Information technology; Canada; Communication in organizations; Organizational sociology; human interaction; information and communication technologies; institutionalism; nonprofit networks; nonprofit organizations; structural models of technology Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

An understanding of sequential art as a unique system of signs undergirds attentive description of instances of nostalgia in the distinctive but wide-ranging work of Daniel Clowes. Despite great variations in tone, this work shares a sense of ambivalence, an expectation of careful reading, and a corresponding proliferation of gaps, all of which is in some way tied to longing. In each of the books examined, longing is emphasised by the formal particularities of comics: the prevailing suggestion of this thesis is that the fundamental operation of sequential art mobilises and makes space for narrative interpolations in a way that is not only comparable to but in a certain sense mimics the historical interpolations of memory. It is the space between panels—which acts as a tangible analogue of memory—that makes comics uniquely suited to nostalgic stories. <em>Modern literature; Comics; American literature; Language; literature and linguistics </em></p> </td>

To ‘be political’ is seen here as a subjective position. The theories of Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser and Michel Foucault are used to inform an approach to subjectivity and explain how social and cultural environments relate to how one understands power relations, identity, and one's place in the world. The author puts forth a political model termed “transformative politics,” which entails critical resistance and cultural production. It is argued that although this model works against oppression and social injustices by bringing politics out of a singular bureaucratic process and into the cultural world, it is near from absent in consumer-capitalism, and neo-liberalism specifically. Transformative politics is not fostered in consumer-capitalism due to the individuation, market public, and commercial culture characterizing this latter system. The current mass media system is presented as the preeminent vehicle for commercial or mass culture, and therefore its political economy and cultural place is considered. Specifically, the news and commercial media coverage of the events of September 11th, 2001 are analyzed based on the public narrative that was constructed to speak to a public subject, at the risk of marginalizing many political identities and dissuading cultural production and critical resistance. The thesis concludes with a brief look towards change in the future, involving struggle for both cultural and structural transformation. <em>Mass media; Political science Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Identifying with and engaging in identity play through an online character can provide the individual with psychological and social benefits. The potential to create a character, or avatar, that can be identified with is the initial step in engaging in identity play. This process has changed significantly with the advent and development of visually oriented games. Through participant-observation conducted in World of Warcraft, textual analysis of online forums associated with the game, and questionnaires, this thesis investigates the ways that visual elements of online games affect the process of identifying with an online self. It argues that although interacting in a virtual environment where everything is immediately visible can ease the identification process, limits on character appearance, movement, and interaction imposed by visually rendering the game simultaneously compromise this benefit. <em>Communication and the arts Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Acknowledging that cross-cultural flow takes a number of forms, that politics and culture increasingly intermingle, and that the West has a long history and geography tied to exploitation and occupation of other countries, this project discusses four benefits in relation to ideas about myth, narrative, celebrity, and memory. Such benefits as the Concerts for Bangladesh, the Sun City project, Freedomfest (The Nelson Mandela Seventieth Birthday Tribute), and America: A Tribute To Heroes, are explored in relation to cultural-political movements and Western imaginings of Bangladesh, South Africa, and Afghanistan. In so doing, the positional superiority of the West is necessarily reconsidered. Benefits are directional pointers through which music narrates storied sociality, mapping the beats of particular histories and geographies. Emphasizing the importance of hearing, and thereby challenging the visual focus of Western culture, readers are encouraged to hear the maps that benefits project through the traces they inevitably leave in popular landscapes. <em>Benefit performances; Popular music; Social movements; Musicians; Mass media; History Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Specifically, this dissertation scrutinizes the provision of access to television programming offered by Canada’s national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Société Radio-Canada (CBC/Radio-Canada), and how CBC/Radio-Canada’s response to Canada’s 2011 digital television transition corresponds with its mandate under the Broadcasting Act to ensure that its programming is “made available throughout Canada by the most appropriate and efficient means and as resources become available for the purpose” (Canada, 1991). Drawing from research interviews conducted with disconnected analogue over-the-air (OTA) CBC/Radio-Canada television-viewing households and members of CBC/Radio-Canada Management involved with the public broadcaster’s response to Canada’s digital television transition deadline, this dissertation finds competing accounts of how public television delivery is linked to the provision of access to the public broadcaster’s television programming in the digital age. While interviewed members of CBC/Radio-Canada Management describe an inefficient analogue OTA public television delivery system that would be best superseded by more efficient modes of digital delivery, OTA CBC/Radio-Canada television-viewing households describe an analog OTA CBC/Radio-Canada television service that had been providing access to CBC/Radio Canada television programming and describe a digital disconnect following CBC/Radio Canada’s digital television transition. This dissertation questions the post-analogue public television delivery operations of CBC/Radio-Canada; mainly that public television delivery cost savings achieved as a result of CBC/Radio-Canada’s response to Canada’s digital television transition deadline have resulted in gaps in access to CBC/Radio-Canada television programming by some Canadian households as articulated through this dissertation’s Public Media Access Puzzle Sieve (Public M.A.P.S.) model. The Public M.A.P.S. model offers a means by which to both anticipate and assess levels of access to public media based on the model’s elements of access related to cost, availability, functionality, opportunities for à la carte service, and access to locally relevant feed(s). In the case of CBC/Radio-Canada, gaps in household access to the public broadcaster’s digital television programming as identified by the Public M.A.P.S. model help to underscore deficiencies in Canada’s post-analogue television system, the information communication technology (ICT) sector, and domestic spectrum management practices. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Although time figures prominently in emerging literature addressing this trend, spatial analyses remain fragmentary. Yet, dance is distinctive from other time-based media because of its heightened relationship with space. This raises an important question: how does dance’s newfound presence ‘re-choreograph’ the spaces of modern art museums? Extending the work of Henri Lefebvre, this dissertation adopts an expanded definition of museum space encompassing physical, social and conceptual domains. Dance, an art concerned with the shaping of space, is examined as a transformative force, productively intervening with the galleries, encounters, objects, and historical narratives comprising modern art museum space. In this study, purity and atemporality are identified as the preeminent principles organizing modern art museum space, and dance, an ‘impure’ and process-based art, is theorized as a productive contaminant, catalyzing change. Using this theoretical framework and Using this theoretical framework and evocative descriptions of Boris Charmatz’s 20 Dancers for the XX Century (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 18-20 October 2013), dance’s unique collaboration with modern art museum space is analyzed. Socially, dance’s multisensuality pollutes museum goers’ ocularcentric experiences with art. Conceptually, dance diversifies understandings of objects and the androcentric history they uphold. Physically, dance is carving out new spaces, with performance venues being incorporated into the ‘bones’ of high profile institutions. Interspersed between these analytical chapters, evocative descriptions of Spatial Confessions (On the Question of Instituting the Public) by Bojana Cvejić and collaborators (Tate Modern, London, 21-24 May 2014) introduce observations beyond the analytical scope, opening up the liminal spaces of this document to ongoing inquiry. This dissertation contributes a sustained analysis of dance’s spatial impact on modern art museums. By investigating how dance intervenes with the limitations of the white cube, it critiques this supposedly ‘blank’ space, questioning its continued supremacy within these institutions. Moreover, as dance is ushered into performance venues within the museum’s expanding domain, this dissertation interrogates the modern propensity for specialization and master narratives pervading the spaces of these institutions, despite decades of interventional artistic and curatorial practices. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Cybernetic, Internet and Actor-Network theories are synthesized in an innovative network analysis framework based on three fundamental network models---oligoptica, agency and actor-networks---and their respective structures, powers and purposes. This network analysis framework is employed to identify shifting distributions of representational power through global networks and to evaluate the role of networks in enhancing or inhibiting self-representational agency. The thesis investigates distributions of representational power in two forms: political-economic representation, involving the representation of subjects as citizens by states and as consumers by markets; and, cultural-communicational representation, involving the encoding of the phenomenological world of objects and experiences in symbolic forms of film, video and digital media. The analysis moves from the broad field of network theory to a detailed examination of contemporary theories and practices of political-economic representation in networked state-market-subject relations and of the growth of oligoptical global market power over states and subjects. This focus narrows to examine the construction of cultural-communicational representation in three divergent national audiovisual space networks---Canada, Mexico and Argentina---and their traditions, structures, institutions, laws, constituent media and artifacts as they are integrated into global market networks through neo-liberal structural adjustment programs. The analytical focus narrows to examine contemporary instances of insurrectional self-representational subject agency in film, video and digital formats to combat the concentration of representational power in oligoptical global market networks in each of the three globalized audiovisual spaces. The thesis determines that the panoptical global information and communications networks have converged with oligopolistic transnational state-market institutions to produce a singular, expansionist, self-reproducing, hierarchical and paradoxically centralizing and decentralizing globally networked oligopticon that tends to absolute command and control, and that wages war on self-representational distributed subject agency networks. This war gives rise to an oscillatory and escalating mimetic dynamic between incommensurable oligoptical and agency networks. The thesis concludes with a synthesis of the implications of the war between oligopticon and agency networks for future struggles for self-representational political-economic and cultural-communicational power. <em>Communication and the arts; Argentina; Audiovisual spaces; Canada; Globalization; Mexico; Networks; Representational relations; Motion pictures Media and Culture;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Recent developments on the web, known as web2.0, have attracted the attention of the field. The thesis contributes to the literature by developing a theoretical approach to web2.0 platforms as social structures and by contributing two cases of web2.0 structurations: Drupal, a content management platform, and The Pirate Bay, a file sharing website and political movement. Adapting the work of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe on articulation theory, the thesis studies the code and politics of the two cases. The Drupal case studies the complex interactions between humans and code, and addresses how Drupal functions as an empty platform allowing its users to reconstitute its digital code. The Pirate Bay case demonstrates how a political movement uses code as part of their political platform. Not only does the group advocate file sharing, they allow thousands of people across the world to share information freely. At a time, when most web2.0 platforms act as forces of capitalism, the two cases demonstrate alternative, commons-based structurations of web2.0. <em>articulation theory; capitalism; code politics; Drupal; humans and code; political movements; The Pirate Bay; Web 2.0; Web 2.0 platforms as social structures.

Where transmission often denotes an act of exchanging information between sender and receiver, transmissive control theorizes transmission as the production and assignment of common times or temporalities between components of a communication system. Transmissive control functions both operationally according to how computational algorithms route Internet data (known as packets) and systematically according to how patterns in these operations express temporalities of coordination and control. Transmissive control questions how algorithms transmit packets and how transmission expresses valuable temporalities within the Internet. The concept of transmissive control developed as a response to advanced Internet routing algorithms that have greater awareness of packets and more capacity to intervene during transmission. The temporality of the Internet is changing due to these algorithms. Where transmissive control has been made possible by the Internet’s core asynchronous design that allows for many different temporalities to be simultaneous (such as real-time networks or time-sharing networks), this diversity has taxed the resources of the Internet infrastructure as well as the business models of most Internet Service Providers (ISPs). To bring the temporality of the Internet back under control, ISPs and other network administrators have turned to transmissive control to better manage their resources. Their activities shift the Internet from an asynchronous temporality to a poly-chronous temporality where network administrators set and manage the times of the Internet. Where this turn to traffic management has often been framed as a debate over the neutrality of the Internet, the dissertation re-orientates the debate around transmissive control. Tactics by the anti-copyright Pirate Bay and Internet transparency projects illustrate potential political and policy responses to transmissive control. The former seeks to elude its control where the latter seeks to expose its operation. These components as well as the operation of transmissive control will be developed through a series of metaphors from the film Inception, the demons of Pandemonium, the novel Moby-Dick and the film Stalker. Each metaphor cooperate to provide a comprehensive discussion of transmissive control. <em>algorithms; anti-copyright; Inception (movie); internet routing; internet service providers (ISP); Moby Dick (novel); online communication; Stalker (movie); temporality of the internet; The Pirate Bay; transmissive control.

Using methods of critical discourse analysis, the text-based comments of users are analyzed to demonstrate that online dialogue is a critical process through which queer women receive media representations that they consider appropriations of marginal sexuality as style. Drawing on work by Teresa de Lauretis, Amy Villarejo, José Esteban Muñoz and Rosemary Hennessey, the author advances a theory of disidentificatory interpretation, in which users articulate psychic pleasure in seeing same-sex desire represented in the mass-mediated public sphere, despite the inherent problems they find in these representations. This mode of reception is situated in the political moment of queer liberalism, where the promise of media presence as an entry to rights-based social and political gains is troubled by user critique. <em>Womens studies; GLBT Studies; Web Studies; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Social sciences </em></p> </td>

This study sits at the intersection of three histories: of commodity consumption, of labour, and of embodiment and subjectivity, arguing that women were active participants in the making, selling, purchasing and wearing of corsets in Toronto, a city that has largely been ignored in fashion history. Between 1871 and 1914 many women worked in large urban factories, and in small, independent manufacturing shops. Toronto’s corset manufacturers were instrumental in the urbanization of Canadian industry, and created employment in which women earned a wage. The women who bought their wares were consumers making informed purchases, enacting agency in consumption and aesthetics; by choosing the style or size of a corset, female consumers were able to control to varying degrees, the shape of their bodies. As a staple in the wardrobe of most nineteenth-century women, the corset complicates the study of conspicuous consumption, as it was a garment that was not meant to be seen, but created a highly visible shape, blurring the lines between private and public viewing of the female body. Marxist analysis of the commodity fetish informs this study, and by acknowledging the ways in which the corset became a fetishized object itself, both signaling the shapeliness of femininity while in fact augmenting and diminishing female bodies. This study will address critical theory regarding the gaze and subjectivity, fashion, and modernity, exploring the relationship women had with corsets through media and advertising. A material culture analysis of extant corsets helps understand how corsets were constructed in Toronto, how the women of Toronto wore them, and to what extent they actually shaped their bodies. Ultimately, it is the aim of this dissertation to eschew common misconceptions about the practice of corsetry and showcase the hidden manner in which women produced goods, labour, and their own bodies in the nineteenth century, within the Canadian context. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture;Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Women are underrepresented in the remembered histories of science and technology, but this is not a negation of their many contributions. “ The Hand of A Dead Woman : Textile Illuminations and the Invisible Labour of Women in LateNineteenth Century Astronomy and Culture” examines the role of women in astronomy through the Harvard Computers' annotations of photographic astronomical glass plates in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In consultation with the Harvard College Observatory’s Digital Access to a sky Century at Harvard (DASCH) project, digital reproductions of annotated photographic plates were obtained and subsequently transferred onto large pieces of silk, with the Computers' annotations ‘ illuminated' by means of phosphorescent embroidery. This paper explores the use of traditional women's crafting technologies in contrast with the scientifically valuable information that the photographic glass plates contain, and provides a meditation on the way women's labour, particularly in the sciences, was both valued and perceived.

The video explores how the invisibility of queer sexuality becomes visible through technologies of representation and manifests as coherent identity through the body. The mythic figure of the monster, a figure that embodies difference and otherness, is appropriated as symbol for the queer body. In RE:FORM; Becoming Visible the monstrous body erupts from a green coloured field and constitutes a visual pattern while at the same time the visual pattern constitutes the body. This relationship symbolizes the paradox of visibility, as the visual structure exists only through the display of bodies. In culture, the representation of identities exists through the visibility of identities, yet identities are limited by naturalized representations that replicate dominant ideologies. The visual pattern is intended as a metaphor for structures inherent in representation that attempt to reproduce dominant ideologies. By subjecting the representation of the monster to the visual pattern, tensions between dominant ideologies and subjects are explored. The growth and collapse of the monstrous body denotes the possibility of resistance to structures in representation. RE:FORM: Becoming Visible resists the efforts to limit identities and explores the possibilities of open, incomplete subjectivity. New forms are created through resistance. The result is a display of growth, collapse, beauty, desire, sexuality and embodiment.&nbsp; <em>avant-garde; embodied subjectivity; gay and lesbian studies; gender and sexuality; lesbian visibility; performance; queer identity; queer visibility; surveillance; video; violence; visibility.

As the capabilities of wireless and mobile technologies have developed to allow consumption of content traditionally broadcast on television, stakeholders have questioned how to ensure culturally-rich, domestically-produced content is available for Canadian audiences by such means. As industry stakeholders have debated the potential value of Canadian content in an increasingly globalized media landscape, technologies have continued to advance, and Canadians have increasingly turned to new media to be informed and entertained. With a lengthy history of media regulation, this paper will demonstrate how the Canadian government's slow, uncoordinated response to developing new media policy effectively perpetuates inhibiting tensions between cultural and economic goals. Questions that frame this enquiry include: What role does Canadian content play as a reflection of Canadian culture and support of the production industry within Canada's traditional broadcasting system? Is regulation of new media important to maintain traditional policy goals? If so, what kinds of regulation might be implemented in this new context? And to what degree does current new media policy succeed in pursuing cultural and industrial goals historically common to Canadian media regulation? In pursuing these questions, this paper will draw conclusions regarding the benefits of federal new media policy, and how the government can better advance domestic digital media production, as technologies continue to evolve. <em>Canada; Canadian audience; Canadian broadcasting policy; Canadian content; Canadian government; domestic digital media production; federal new media policy; media regulation; new media; policy; television.

This paper uses a case study of the Indian experience of adapting to international treaty mandated changes to domestic patent law and the 2011 announcement of an IP lawsuit over the alleged biopiracy of genetic material from a traditional Indian plant variety, and connects the experience of an individual country to the wider body of research and theory that exists on the relationship between IP and development for non-Western countries. The paper also provides a discourse analysis of the public reaction, as covered by English-language Indian newspapers, to the lawsuit launched against Monsanto, the Maharashtra Hybrid Seed Company, the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharward, and the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University by the governmental organization the National Biodiversity Authority over the development of the transgenic Bt brinjal crop. <em>activist counterpublics; biopirarcy; commercialization; global economy; Government of India; intellectual property; intellectual property rights; Monsanto Corporation; privatization; publics and counterpublics; public knowledge.

These films are identified and defined in this dissertation as remasculation pictures, or narratives that showcase the hero’s oscillation between two oppositional expressions of screen masculinity. In the rhetoric of the remasculation film, the protagonist’s emasculation initiates a quest to remasculate by reaffirming the dominance and authority of the hypermasculine archetype. Further, in a few key performances (Red River [1948], The Searchers [1956], The Wings of Eagles [1957]), John Wayne exemplifies the ultra-conservative values, imposing physicality, staunch heterosexuality, and capability of this heteronormative, hypermasculine archetype. However, Wayne’s image has been employed only as an exemplification of this façade, since this project does not suggest that the remasculation hero’s victory marks his appropriation of Wayne’s masculinity, only the archetype with which many of his performances have been associated. The remasculation picture is part of a film cluster, and not a genre because films of this category are primarily linked by similarities in narrative structure and their glorification of this hypermasculine figure. Further, to illustrate some of the themes of the remasculation picture, this dissertation features three chapters that focus on as many distinct expressions of the remasculation formula. The first of these chapters draws on Unforgiven (1992) and Law Abiding Citizen (2010) to furnish a discussion of judicial emasculation and remasculatory vigilantism. The second case study chapter looks at remasculation through pugilism with an examination of Payback (1999) and Get Carter (2000), while the final section focuses only on The Company Men (2010) to illustrate emasculative redundancy and the reacquisition of purpose as the final variation discussed in this project. While films of the remasculation cluster glorify the hypermasculine image, one cannot assume that the filmmakers responsible for their production aim to either disseminate ultra-conservative values or impose them on the audience. Similarly, the relative popularity of remasculation films does not necessarily indicate the presence of an audience seeking narrative diegeses showcasing the reaffirming triumph of the hypermasculine man. The continued production of the remasculation picture signifies only the appearance of a trend in contemporary film that is attributable to the destabilization of the normative masculine image at the end of the twentieth century. <em>cinema; film masculinity; heteronormativity; hypermasculinity; hypermasculine archetype; remasculation films; pugilism; vigilantism.

In fact roughly 96 percent of the annual screen time of Canadian theatres is occupied by foreign-produced, mostly American, films. This thesis recognizes that the motion picture distributor in particular the Hollywood studio firm, holds the balance of power in the Canadian film industry. Using a political and economy framework, this thesis identifies five unique channels of distribution within the Canadian motion picture distribution system and through historical analysis, investigates the political and economic motivations behind their formation. The results of this analysis reveal that because the industry's distribution structure was negotiated between political and corporate actors under asymmetrical conditions of power, it places limitations upon the exchange of cultural resources across and within borders, restricts intra-industry firm-level negotiations, and perpetuates the dominant market preference for Hollywood films and the underperformance of domestic films within the Canadian marketplace. <em>Motion pictures; Government policy; Canada; Motion picture industry; Canada; Motion pictures; Production and direction; Government policy; Canada; Motion pictures; Economic aspects; Canada Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Working with and against the grain of older theories of cultural and media imperialism and newer theories of cultural and media globalization, this dissertation examines the current "state of cultural imperialism." It builds on and bridges political-economy and cultural studies approaches to the state, the cultural industry, international relations, imperialism, ideology, hegemony, and popular media-culture to illuminate the governmental and corporate structures, institutions, policies, practices, mediums, and texts that articulate the geopolitical imperatives of the U.S. foreign policy establishment to the economic imperatives of the U.S. cultural industries. A political-economy and textual analysis of the multiple points of concrete and discursive convergence between the U.S. foreign policy establishment (the U.S. state Department, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other agencies) and the U.S. cultural industries (Hollywood, news corporations, and video game corporations) highlights a complex and contradictory symbiotic (as opposed to inherently antagonistic) U.S. state-capital complex of cultural production. Though this dissertation mainly focuses on the new characteristics, practices, and products of the state-capital complex in the post-9/11 conjuncture of the U.S.-led "war on terrorism," it also emphasizes the historical antecedents of this state-capital form. The U.S. cultural industries depend on strong state support to facilitate and legitimize their local and global economic expansion. The U.S. state, in turn, attempts to mobilize the informational and image powers of the cultural industries to legitimize its foreign policy ideologies and actions in national and international spheres. <em>Communication and the arts; Mass communications; Cultural imperialism; Foreign policy; Political economy Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

The main problem in media education today is that it has evolved out of a text-based focus and has been ill equipped to adequately address issues that transcend a direct relationship with discreet media texts and systems of production. Given that this is a problem, a case study approach was used to explore what employing a media education curriculum with a group of teenaged girls involved in an existing life-skills program might suggest as an alternative point of intervention, rather than the critical examination of media texts or the contexts of their production and reception. This study was concerned with what could be learned about both media education and communication theory by de-centering the focus on textual analysis and replacing it with a focus on life-skills that address how media are implicated in our lives far beyond textual experiences. What this work contributes to the literature is a way in which a contextual rather than transactional model of communication can be used to identify a different way of considering the dynamics of our interdependent and ecological relationship with media. This research provides an opportunity to think about how our experience of media is not just a meeting of discreet and separate actors, but is an interdependent and ecological relationship. What was found is that girls do not simply 'read' media; they live through media by taking up what they experience through media texts, transposing it into the narratives of their lives, extending it, and making it 'real.' It is by addressing these processes of living through media that a media education life-skills model is proposed. <em>Mass media; Communication and the arts; Girls; Living through media; Media life-skills; Twenty-first century Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Feature films, with their captive audiences and finely-tuned marketing machines, may seem like ideal venues for advertisers to present goods to consumers in the form of placed products, yet even here the effects of economic and cultural synergy cannot be guaranteed. The thesis argues that while we live in a commodified environment where the consumer spectacle is woven into the fabric of everyday life, the meanings we derive from mass-produced products is not strictly limited to the interests of corporate capital. By providing a history of product placement in Hollywood cinema and three recent films as case studies, this thesis explores the impact of product placement on the creative agency of writers, directors, designers and audiences.

Since the election of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2015, Canada has recommitted to bolstering discourses of multiculturalism. There have been, however, lasting impacts from mainstream discourses that followed 9/11, which positioned Middle Eastern women as imperiled and Middle Eastern culture as backward. Additionally, liberal multiculturalism in Canada has done little to address systemic racism, and instead encourages a superficial level of acceptance. Contradictions of multiculturalism can be found in the narratives of these women, who sometimes repeat discourses that do not benefit them. Conversely, women who have access to discourses that position multiculturalism as ideological, have a difficult time expressing a Canadian identity and display a critical understanding of their experiences. These narratives are considered in a wider context of how race and racism structure Canada today. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Alternative media and the politics of representation</strong><br> Marcos Moldes (2009); Supervised by Jean Bruce</p> <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> In the last thirty years gay bodies have had an increased presence in all forms of media representations. In print, entire magazines and newspapers devoted to queer issues have appeared and lesbians star on popular television shows. Developments such as these are something that was unthinkable not so long ago. The Internet is another medium that has emerged at the same time as queer culture has come of age. This new medium is full of gay bloggers, podcasts and web sites all devoted to queer issues. These are just a few indications of what can be considered the growing acceptance of gays and lesbians in North America. However, mainstream gay representation is not so straightforward that it can be seen as an entirely positive development. Although the emergence of mainstream gay media is often discussed as being an encouraging step forward for the gay rights movement, representations of gays and lesbians on television and in print are not necessarily a sign of universal acceptance for members of this community. Instead, they often represent the assimilation/co-option of a small segment of the ideal imagined gay and lesbian community, those who mirror in many ways the straight world of consumer subjects. Inclusion into the dominant culture as consumers is not a complete step forward for the gay community, for it does not indicate a broader enfranchisement into mainstream culture. Images that glorify the gay consumer are often promoted as being progressive solely because they contain representations of gay bodies. <em>Cultural anthropology; Social sciences Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Women’s labour force participation more than doubled throughout the war, with more women working alongside and in place of men than ever before. This created a situation that could challenge the traditional sexual division of labour, and so women’s labour became a subject for discussion in the public sphere. Through a comparative content analysis of the commercial and alternative (labour) press, this study examines representations of women’s labour in wartime in the context of women’s mobilization into the war effort through to subsequent demobilization near war’s end. It first considers the theoretical and methodological issues involved in the historical study of news media and women and then offers original empirical research to demonstrate that when women’s labour did emerge as a subject in the Canadian press, gender, not labour, was prioritized in the news. This was symbolically and systematically leveraged both within and across the commercial and alternative press, which reinforces stereotypical values about women and their labour and upheld the patriarchal status quo. In the end, while there were surface-level changes to the nature of women’s paid labour during the war, the structures of female subordination and exploitation remained unchallenged despite women’s massive mobilization into the workforce. By setting media representations against the wartime realities of women’s labour told through archival records and secondary literature, this dissertation argues that news media generally presented a ‘history’ of women’s labour that did not reflect the lived reality or the political economic and social significance of women’s labouring lives. This not only coloured how women’s labour was represented in the news, but it can also shape the history that scholars construct from the newspaper. In contributing to feminist media and media history scholarship, this dissertation offers empirical evidence that challenges dominant ways of thinking about women’s history in terms of the domestic sphere and furthers an understanding of women’s wage labour as a provocation to such historical public-private divisions. This may, in turn, inspire histories that more fully and equitably capture women’s experiences. <em>Canada; Canadian press; commercial and alternative (labour) press; feminism; feminist media; gender and sexuality; news media; sexual divisions of labour; women’s history; women’s labour; women’s media representations; World War II.

The research collects all the subjects' utterances of political language in a period of 90 days before their respective election dates, in selected print and television media. Once the sample is freed of its redundant parts, two content analyses are carried out on the two corpi of material: a de-contextualized content analysis (single word count) and a contextualized content analysis (categorized sentence/phrase count). The contextualized content analysis produces categories of EHL, and three categories per subject are examined to test published generalizations about their "main messages" present in the scholarly literature. A comparative analysis underlines the similarities and differences in the subjects' respective electoral hortatory languages. Finally, the significant theoretical notions pertaining to the field of political language are applied to the quantitative and qualitative findings, and the conclusion presents suggestions for further research. <em>Communication; Political science; Mass communications; Social sciences; Communication and the arts </em></p> </td>

However, there also emerges from Canada's history a legacy of racial prejudice, discrimination, and disadvantage. As numerous studies have shown, racist attitudes and beliefs persist in Canada, even though they are not always apparent to those unaffected by their direct repercussions.

It took a radical perceptual shift in the postwar national consciousness, a shift that saw everyday American people questioning their faith in some of the fundamental truths about the American way of life and their security in a rapidly changing world, to press Stewart into bringing to life on screen a more mature yet psychologically bruised self. At any rate, the more nefarious aspects of urban modernity fuelled the visions of a handful of prominent Hollywood directors mid century, and it is the concern of the following two essays to confront how in two of those director's pictures one made by Hitchcock, the other by Ford and each starring James Stewart some of the unique anxieties associated with this socio-historical period are animated. Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) is the focus of the first chapter. Released during the height of Cold War Hysteria, the film has been the object of much critical scholarship for its grim attention to modernity's more unsavory offerings. The nastier side of the modern impulse is at the centre of Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), the focus of chapter two. This chapter is similarly attached to the theme of urbanization. But instead of "reading" the cues in multiple aspects of the film's visual architecture, my meditation on Liberty Valance engages predominantly with the embodied features-that is, the movements, sensorial aptitude and gun-slinging prowess-Stewart's performance in the film's leading role as Ransom Stoddard. <em>Alfred Hitchcock; audience; celebrity; Hollywood; James Stewart; John Ford; masculinity; popular culture; post-war anxiety; The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; sensory experiences; urban modernity; Vertigo; visual architecture; World War II.

If so, how are music brands created? To explore these questions, I present case studies of marketing materials from albums by Keane, Radiohead, U2 and Wilco. Branding reveals itself as a process that creates expectations among consumers, critics and others. Expectations can hinder artist creativity and result in increased standardization of the music product. However, brands may offer artists a level of control. This investigation has implications for all parties involved in the business of music and provides cultural industry researchers a unique way of analyzing the impact of marketing and branding on commodities while accounting for the complexities presented by the consumption of cultural goods. <em>Popular music; Marketing; Branding (Marketing); Music trade; Marketing </em></p> </td>

This paper will identifY why risk appears to trump rights in the current security environment and explain why security cannot be privileged over rights as rights are an integral part of public security. The state appears to view security as purely, or at least primarily, physical, however, if the state concentrates counterterrorist efforts on physical security, then this ignores the social aspects of security and therefore does not provide an adequate level of protection for its citizens but only advances the interests of the state. There are several ways in which the need for state security and desire to preserve democratic freedoms and values can be balanced without sacrificing one over the other, but this must begin with dialogue between the state and its citizens. <em>Canada; Canadian citizens; Canadian policy; communications technology; civil rights; Communications Security Establishment (CSE); counterterrorism; government surveillance; illegal surveillance; privacy rights; surveillance technology; terrorism.

Unfortunately, internal discrepancies are often dismissed as indicators of political ambivalence, or treated as formal flaws that need to be overcome. To address this gap, this dissertation draws from game studies, media studies, and political economics to investigate the contradictory relationships between popular games and neoliberalism, specifically in relation to playful forms of resistance and critique that emerge during gameplay. Part I develops this study’s methodology by drawing from corresponding uses of assemblage theory, specifically articulated in Ong (2006, 2007), Lazzarato (2012, 2015), and Gilbert’s (2013) control society approaches to neoliberalism and Taylor (2009), Pearce and Artemesia’s (2009) digital ethnographic approaches to play. Derived from the French agencement, assemblage theory emphasizes heterogeneous relations in constant states of becoming that are understood as being real. Part II implements the aforementioned methodology by examining some of the most popular gaming franchises produced to date, with each demonstrating emergent political correlations and dissonances springing from relationships between different ludic and narrative components. BioShock (2007–2013) and Red Dead Redemption (2011) are narratively structured by neoliberal discourse, yet each storyline fails to correspond with the resistant political logic embedded in their respective rule systems. Conversely, Call of Duty (2004 – present) attains a high level of political cohesion that does not result in a better playing experience, as much as it contributes to conflicts amongst publishers, developers, and fans. Finally, Minecraft (2009–present) provides a fascinating example of a game that representationally reinforces neoliberalism while simultaneously affording the creation of new digital objects, including objects that give players the opportunity to understand and appreciate the computational infrastructures that a neoliberal emphasis on source code takes for granted. This dissertation, as a result, charts the growing connections between emergent gameplay and new forms of resistance and critique—connections that contribute not only to game studies, but also to the study of digital media and the interdisciplinary study of neoliberalism. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

This research contributes to the creation of a Canadian Edible CampusDatabase (ECD) that can be used as a network for future collaborations within the campus sustainability community, thus creating opportunities for education, research and community engagement. The database contains information about practices, size, and origin of EdibleCampuses across Canada. The database also creates a participant pool for a survey aimed at understanding the diversity of Edible Campuses. Edible Campus team members were asked to respond to questions regarding the goals, barriers and benefits for their food production initiatives. It is the finding of this research that Edible Campuses often exceed beyond ‘greening the school’ by demonstrating sustainability through the physical structure, teaching practice,research, and relationships with people and nature. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

While Donna Haraway defines the "cyborg" as a hybrid of machine and organism and, hence, a gender-free entity in cybernetic culture, human beings interacting during online communication are often conceived as disembodied selves, thus devoid of any gender identity. The problematic condition of the negation of gender is, however, an oversight of the nature of 'sexuality' and sexual 'subjectivity' of human beings in cybernetic culture. Nevertheless, images in science fiction films and chat forums in Internet communication not only reveal diverse sexual identities, thus challenging the absence of gender in cyberspace, but manifests kinesthetic features in the embodiment of cybersexuality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this thesis, I theorize and inaugurate 'kineticism' as the structural condition and state of existence of human body and sexuality, and its subversive potential for sexual emancipation in cyberspace. The word 'kineticism' is intended to suggest the system of ideas and condition of 'motion' that denote the 'structure' and 'mode of existence' as manifested in the 'choreography' and 'tectonics' of cyberbodies. To support my point of view, I will be drawing upon the theoretical perspectives of postmodernism and cyberfeminist theory. For the purpose of conducting this research, I will be employing a qualitative methodology of critical discourse analysis. As for the sources of this research, I would be using theoretical texts as found in both print and online publications as well as images in cyberpunk films and digital art in new media culture.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Deconstructing ideological notions of fixed sexuality and gender in human society, this research discovers and affirms a kinetic sexuality in cyberbodies. Introducing 'kineticism' as the 'structural condition' and 'mode of existence' of embodiment and sexuality in cyberspace, this thesis will not only contribute an original theoretical knowledge of sexual subjectivity and emancipation of human bodies in digital culture but offer a critical advancement of contemporary social and feminist theory as well. <em>Cultural anthropology; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Social sciences Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Looking back at the area's progression from farming village, to working-class industrial centre, to gentrifying creative hub, provides the historical context for a further consideration of the current challenges and conflicts that are impacting the community today. In 2008 a land dispute over a proposed big-box style retail development divided the community and instigated a yearlong battle at the Ontario Municipal Board between Toronto city council and private developers. In tracing the historical growth of Leslieville and analyzing the current development issues, this study examines how urban development and cultural policy have influenced the transformation of this unique Toronto neighbourhood. An application of the theoretical literature on gentrification and photographs are provided in order to supplement the analysis. By identifying Leslieville as a neighbourhood in transition and examining it as a case study in the process and impact of gentrification and neighbourhood change this research contributes to a further understanding of the nature of urban space and how it should be developed to serve the interests of Toronto's diverse population. <em>Canada; community; cultural policy; developmental issues; gentrification; Leslieville; photography; retail development; Toronto; urban development; urban space.

Dedicated to using communication as a means of bringing about positive social change, it nonetheless privileges a consumer-oriented, behavior-driven approach based on marketing principles and a rationally-based, individual decision-making paradigm. Such an approach is overly reductive, neglecting the cultural and structural forces that impinge on our social relations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This dissertation aims to enhance social marketing's capacity to serve as a tool for social change by incorporating a cultural dimension that also accounts for structural concerns. It introduces the work of John B. Thompson who, in his extensive work on culture and ideology, argues for the primacy of meaning and its impact on the material conditions of our lives. But Thompson acknowledges that analysis is not enough. Creating positive social change depends on the active reconstruction of meaning. This is where framing theory comes in. It provides an entry into the struggle over meaning and its power to effect social change.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet framing theory itself is underdeveloped. The empirical research in this dissertation, therefore, attempts to explore some key framing issues. Conducted through an ethnographic study within a social marketing agency, a number of key questions were addressed. What are the conceptual methodological parameters for developing frames? What are the rules and routines? Who is involved in creating frames? Who has authority? Is there a particular discourse around framing? Where is ideology embedded and how is it manifested? Because the scholarship has not explored these questions, we do not know what it takes to construct a frame that will motivate social change. We do not know how an effective frame gets developed. The findings are new to the field given that, to my knowledge, no one has previously looked at the internal operations of an agency as it prepares its clients' work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The end result is a reconceputalized model of social marketing in which meaning—in the form of frames—is put front and centre. In this framework, social marketing might be employed as a cultural means of influencing change through the construction and reconstruction of meaning and representation. <em>Communication and the arts; Framing; Marketing; Meaning; Social change; Social marketing </em></p> </td>

We establish this new relationship with materiality through our sensory bodies. We conceive of ourselves differently and allow ourselves to move and behave in ways that are not acceptable in the world outside of the museum. We perform our new selves with permission granted by the sense of place that cannot be understood other than through embodied experience–of things, of selves, of the environment that brings it all together. In the coming together of all these elements in the immediate, intimate present, the notion of the past is defined as cultural heritage as mediated through the historic house museum curatorial work and space. I approach historic house museums as socially created and lived kinds of spatiality and sites of social practices and focus on the experiences of people that spend considerable amounts of time there–the museum staff. As a researcher, I have inserted myself within the environment of a historic house museum and attempted to open it to social inquiry through various ways of being within it–observing, writing, interviewing, interacting, sensing, entering it and leaving it. I have carried out a form of phenomenological ethnography, which included a two-year autoethnographic study at the Mackenzie House Museum, in Toronto, Canada, where I volunteered in the position of an interpreter and a historic cook; 24 participant observation visits to other historic house museums in Toronto; and 13 in-depth unstructured interviews with museum staff from various historic house museum sites in the city. The three methods addressed the key conceptual clusters–emplacement, materiality, and performance, which form three analytical chapters of the dissertation. The dissertation positions historic house museums as forms of heterotopia that function as contestations of the accepted spatial, social, and temporal norms within an urban environment. These museums come forth as attempted reconstructions of anthropological places, in the form of domestic sites that assert significance of material manifestations of familial relations and historical heritage. These sites are immersive environments bridge the gap in the current experience of body, time, and space. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Specifically, this thesis asks, is silicon just an innocuous conveyor of information? What is the relationship between the medium (digital coding in the form of bits) and its material substratum (silicon)? In other words, how does silicon, the carrier, processor, and translator of binary codes, affect the digital messages themselves? To assess the nature of the relationship between material and medium from a historical perspective, this thesis examines the analyses of Walter Benjamin, Harold Innis, and Marshall McLuhan and their hypotheses regarding art and architecture; paper and print; and electric media respectively. Also, this essay presents an analysis of how modes of signifying may indicate material and cultural biases (e.g., binarism and systems of logic) with reference to Walter Ong and Renaissance mathematician Peter Ramus.

Through a variety of means, digital devices are “dematerialized.” That is, a digital object’s material components are denied and concealed by complex cultural and economic practices that support a myth of immaterial and ubiquitous computing without material consequences. Since the early days of digital computing, designers have striven to design devices that are smaller, better, denser, and faster. These traits are framed as ideals against which new products are measured and they have encouraged a desire for ubiquitous, imperceptible integration of digital computing at all levels of modern life. This dissertation argues that the digital object is dematerialized and that this pervasive reduction of the physical object and our very awareness of the physicality of digital materials inhibits our ability to support awareness of the material limits and often detrimental impacts of digital devices. However, the material nature of the digital object may be more apparent after an object is rendered obsolete. Drawing from media archaeology, thing theory, and material culture studies, this dissertation examines a few “afterlives” of digital objects because it is only after its useful life that the object’s materiality takes on transformative powers. For example, when discarded, its physical properties become problematic and may be framed as an environmental issue. Or, when treated as a material artifact in a museum the digital object resists historicity, and when saved as a memento it may take on unexpected nostalgic power. I argue that it is precisely the dematerialized aspects of the informatic media that have created the situation of ‘e-waste’ and it is through a new consciousness of their materiality that we might think about how these technologies evolve and occupy space in the future. <em>digital devices; digital objects; e-waste; environmental issues; informatics media; material artifacts; material culture; media archeology; nostalgia; thing theory.

Information and communication technologies (lCTs) have long been a source of study for theorists and practitioners of international development, starting with study of the telegraph, fixed phone, and radio. However with the advent of digital technologies, the size of devices has shrunken while simultaneously their power has expanded. This paper discusses one segment of the development communications paradigm, the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in relation to gender. One focus that demands greater scrutiny is gender. It's important to ask who is benefiting the most from using ICTs in development. For women in particular, using and accessing communications is more difficult than it is for men, a situation that authors of gender and technology studies have coined 'the Gender Digital Divide'. <em>Computers and women; Uganda; Sex differences in education; Computers; Study and teaching; Digital divide </em></p> </td>

With regards to the collective memory of Canadians, it is thus imperative to address the media narrative that has undoubtedly assisted in the construction of a 'national psyche' in Canada. Following interpretive logics of inquiry, this intrinsic case study will explore the creation of a national sports culture in Canada, and how it has manifested through the CBC's broadcast television operation. In particular, the primary objective is to analyze the position of the CBC in the cultural production of hockey in Canada. By exploring the CBC's television program Hockey Night in Canada this paper strives to better understand how hockey has emerged as a social phenomenon, and how identity-building organizations such as the national broadcaster· have institutionalized hockey lore and tradition in Canadian culture. Through Canada's obsession with the sport of hockey it may be possible to better understand the dynamics at play in the nation's cultural, socio-political and economic realms. <em>Canada; Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC); hockey; Hockey Night in Canada; identity politics; mass media; media spectacle; nationalism; national broadcaster; national sports culture; public broadcasting.

New media have appeared while older media have evolved to offer us hundreds of channels and virtually unlimited access to information and entertainment. Along with these developments, our acceptance and appetite for media and technology has also shifted. In 1990 for example, only 10.4% of Canadian households owned a computer and 12.6% had VCRs (Manna, 2002, p. 18). A little over a decade later, in 2001 more than 70% of Canadian homes had computers and VCR penetration reached 93%, according to a report from the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement (ibid.). Cable and satellite subscriptions, Internet access, and mobile telephone use have also increased substantially in the last decade. Given what appears to be a vigorous proliferation of media technology, it is hardly surprising that children are becoming remarkably 'media savvy'. <em>Technology and children; Mass media and children; Television and children; Computers and children; Children; Social conditions; 21st century </em></p> </td>

To the extent that the CRTC's decision, based on findings of the potential for abusive speech on Al-Jazeera, had the effect of constraining freedom of expression, it was perceived as smacking of censorship, and an assault on freedom of expression. However, the CRTC appears to have adopted a more nuanced perspective towards the matter. In this dissertation, I argue that understanding the Al-Jazeera decision and CRTC's enforcement abusive speech regulations requires an understanding of public policy as a governmental concept, and of regulation as a device for achieving desired socio-political policy outcomes. It also requires a comprehension of key Canadian broadcasting policy ideas. I therefore drew on the concepts of imagined communities and the right to communicate as perspectives for conceptualising these policy ideas. Using an approach informed by the discourse analytical category of articulation, I interrogated the discursive regulatory conversations that characterised the Al-Jazeera application proceeding and that consequently impacted the CRTC's decision on the application. My analysis of the application, interventions made with respect to the application, relevant media reports and commentary, as well as the decision, suggests that the institutional agency of the CRTC in determining the application was structured by the discourse of Canadian broadcasting policy and regulation. And to the extent that parties to the regulatory process situated interventions within this discourse, they succeeded in impacting the process. As well, in the regulatory proscription of abusive speech on the airwaves, the CRTC balances freedom of expression against the underlying values of Canadian multicultural democracy. I suggest therefore that while at the inception of Canadian broadcasting policy in 1932, broadcasting was mobilised as an instrument of nation-building that would combat geographical impediments to nationhood, within the same context of nation-building, the current challenge for Canadian broadcasting policy includes fostering and supporting a cohesive multicultural and multiethnic national community. The challenges, objectives, and discourse of Canadian broadcasting policy, therefore constitute the context in which the CRTC regulates free speech in the public interest. <em>Public administration; Mass communications; Freedom of speech; Public interest; Terrorism; Canadians; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Al-Jazeera; Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission; Free speech; Public interest Media and Culture;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

My photographic practice is conducted within and mediated by significant beliefs about gender and, in turn, provides ideological support for how I relate to society. Acknowledging that I photograph from a female perspective I photographed both male and female subjects of different genders and races using a 35mm camera with a wideangle lens. I captured images that helped me reflect on my own practice as a photographer. My images can be viewed as individual photographs or as a set. Factors, such as my cultural background, social status, religious beliefs, and level of comfort with my own sexuality, influenced my photographic practice and so will inevitably affect how viewers respond to my images. How I feel about identity construction permeates through out my image making process. As a photographer in the Ryerson University and York University joint program of Communication and Culture exploring different theoretical frameworks undoubtedly affected my studio practice as I gained more knowledge and became more self-reflective.

My research concerns how women used the salon to assume traditionally masculine positions of power and intellect and to reject the prevailing gender stereotypes of their time. Specifically, I am interested in the subversive gender dynamics of the Stettheimer salon in New York. From 1915 to 1935, the three Stettheimer sisters -- Ettie, Carrie, and Florine -- held a literary salon in Upper West Side New York. The Stettheimer salon had a distinctively feminine feel (Bilski and Braun 126). Its guest list was filled with effeminate habitués like Marcel Duchamp and Carl Van Vechten, who were encouraged to embrace their feminine side whilst in the salon space (Bilski and Braun 134). Even the sisters subverted their socially ascribed gender roles: they were all unmarried, financially independent and ruled over their male habitués (Bilski and Braun 131). This play with gender also manifested itself in the sisters’ creative works, namely Ettie’s novels, Carrie’s dollhouse, and Florine’s artworks and poetry. Since both the sisters’ salon and their creative work advanced progressive sexual politics, there is room to consider how these two cultural phenomena were mutually constitutive. Thus, I aim to investigate the following research question: How did the Stettheimer sisters’ salon and creative oeuvre collectively endorse a playful and subversive attitude towards gender?&nbsp;<em>artistic movements; feminism; gender and sexuality; gender performativity; male gaze; salon; salon theory; Stettheimer Salon; subversive sexual politics.

This is placing significant strain on the regulator's existing approach to new media regulation. Since 1999, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has employed a policy of non-regulation-or as I will argue in this paper, a policy of non-policy regarding new media broadcasting undertakings (NMBUs). While NMBUs cast a wide net in terms of what we would classify under this term, its most widely known proponents-"over-the-top" (OTT) providers like Netflix Inc., Hulu, Apple TV, and countless others are taking the lion's share of the criticism and concern in Canada by broadcasters and social groups like ACTRA, and the Canadian Media Production Association (CMPA). This paper will provide an environmental scan of the existing approach to new media regulation in Canada by examining The Broadcasting Act, the New Media Exemption Order (NMEO), and the OTT Fact-Finding Mission (and results). This exploration will identify existing policy gaps, provide a history of the regulatory model, and highlight a brief case study on the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the United Kingdom that has adopted an umbrella regulatory model that may be useful when exploring new options for new media policy in Canada. Finally, it will identify some existing roadblocks for undertaking such a policy review by looking specifically at the legislative confines of The Broadcasting Act. <em>Broadcasting Act; Canada; Canadian media; Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC); media policy; new media broadcasting; new media regulation; public and private broadcasting.

As demonstrated by the prevalence of sacred inclinations embedded in the moral consciousness of Polish peasant history, sacrum is the innate orientation towards realities that transcend time and matter - the active and passive reflection of that which lies outside the realm of human sensory experience. At its core, this project explores sacred elements embedded in Polish culture - these elements are not merely reflected upon, but are also reacted to and acted upon by the artist, thus revealing the forgotten sacredness of the most mundane objects and practices of human life. As such, this creative process functions as a research tool, which, by using interdisciplinary illuminations, now acts as a stimulus for the creation of new knowledge. Utilizing the notion of praxis, this project determines whether artistic expression facilitates the communication and sharing of undiluted knowledge. The ultimate aim of this endeavour is to understand the extent to which the artistic process is capable of sustaining the pure essence of expression, and of mediating the transcendent elements inherent in human culture.</p> <p>The approach taken is based on the richness of signals emanating from the artist's own personal history. It includes not only that which is utterly personal, but also that which is culturally determined, offering insight into the various social forces shaping the content of one's own self-identity. The process of tracing the lineage of a personal story is the chosen means used to deconstruct the complexity of cultural tectonics. Through a series of ritualistic actions, embedded with both personal and cultural significance, a transformation takes place, in that, the resulting disarray of energies, now freed from the skeletal structure of self-reality, reveal a sharper, more enlightened view of the spirit that permeates the artist's enveloping culture.</p> <p>The conclusions derived, highlight the inherent complexity of the artistic cycle and the various ways in which the intended message is distorted and/or misinterpreted. However, as suggested by the study's findings, this unavoidable, resulting distortion need not detract in any way from the inherent value of artistic expression and the artistic process. The creative journey taken was truly successful in the realization of a fuller, broader understanding of personal identity within a larger cultural, historical context. In addition, the commitment to praxis, as opposed to passive reflection, successfully revealed evidence of sacrum's inherent, interwoven existence within a greater personal and cultural ontology.&nbsp;<em>art installation; artistic expression; artistic processing; lineage; mixed media; Poland; Polish history; personal and cultural history; sacrum; self-identity.

Increasingly, higher education is applying a customer-service approach to the student-professor relationship that is undermining effective pedagogy. Edwin Guthrie (1954) notes that the function of the University is to attempt to insure that the following generation will be more good, wise, and knowing than the present one" (p.l). Student evaluations of teaching effectiveness are often used to ensure that the function is fulfilled. Student rating websites such as Ratemyprofessr.com (RMP) offers an online community forum that exists outside the institution, where students can anonymously share evaluations of instructors with others. Students can choose instructors and courses based on the ratings. However they are selecting their professors relative to criteria that fulfills a pedagogy that is fuelled not by the drive for an enriched knowledge but by a pedagogy that is influenced by a consumer and academic culture convergence. These consumer attitudes towards higher education are spilling over into the institution and faculty members are suffering the impact. Professors need to have the freedom to motivate students to learn without having to be concerned with entertaining them. It has been argued that Universities need to re-instate their legitimacy and remind students that degrees are granted on a learning basis, not for tuition payment (Delucchi &amp; Korgen 2002). Without a re-establishment of an academic ethic, the University could fall prisoner to the pedagogically irresponsible demands of their customers. <em>academic culture; academic ethic; commercialization; consumerism; higher education; online community; online forums; pedagogy; ratemyprofessor.com; students as consumers; student ratings; university faculty.

Because this technology is continually evolving, as is the way in which people are starting to use it, much of the research remains inconclusive as to any predictions of how this technology will to be used. In the meantime, much has been made about mobile technology's potential to change the way we interact and communicate with one another, and how these changes might have the ability to alter social relations forever. What I would like to examine are the locations where mobile technology and social relations intersect, and the manner in which the two inform each other. More specifically, I would like to focus on the areas where mobile technologies (cell phones, Blackberries, text messaging) affect social life, such as collective behaviour, political action, as well as public sphere and public space issues. Much has been made about the supposed benefits of technology and its potential to collectivize, politicize and, above all, mobilize our society. However, is this constant telephony really living up to this potential? In an environment already saturated with communication technology, billion-dollar advertising expenditures and media multinationals, will the addition of new technologies benefit those seldom heard or only add to the white noise?"--Pages 2-3. <em>advertising; Blackberry; civic life; consumerism; democracy; democratic participation; internet; marketing; mobile technology; neoliberalism; neoliberal subjects; political action; public and private spheres; public spaces; text messaging.

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> This dissertation revisits the question of the temporal constitution of sociality. What is the role of subjective time-experience in the understanding of other people and the formation of communicative environment? This problem is considered in a generative phenomenological context. The investigation traces analytically the “stages” of communicative constitution: from the explicit intentional modes of interaction back to the pre-affective and habitualized social sense-accomplishments. The task is approached through a systematic exposition of Edmund Husserl's generative concept of communication proper (Mitteilung, Kommunikation). A widespread view in the classical and more recent phenomenological scholarship is that Husserl’s concept of communication must be derivative of the more fundamental categories of empathy and intersubjectivity (Einfühlung and Intersubjektivität; Schütz 1957; Held 1972; Zahavi 1996). The theoretical potential of the concept of communication for a phenomenology of sociality has thus been largely overlooked. The dissertation challenges this long-established model and attempts to reaffirm the central constitutive role of communication, to redefine its function in contradistinction with that of empathy. It does so by considering Husserl’s later “genetic phenomenology” where temporal experiences are construed in the background of the sphere of “primal flowing living present” (urströmende lebendige Gegenwart). On this basis, the notion of communication is uncovered as transcendentally rooted in the structure of pre-conscious instinctual Ineinander. This perspective is radicalized and validated through an extensive analysis of Levinas’s implicit debate with Husserl regarding the temporal constitution of alterity and also translated into a problem of the ethical meaning of objective forms of social communication. The central argument of the dissertation is that an interpretation of Husserl’s concept of communication in connection with the notions of primal temporal flow, instincts, and pre-intentional passive synthesis affords the elaboration of a generative phenomenological concept of “intermonadic communication” which grounds empathy rather than deriving from it. Such an interpretation might further prove productive for the study of both nonverbal interaction (also in relation to treatments of autism) and the developmental basis of social behaviour. Its potential to validate an ethical theory of interpersonal understanding is also affirmed through a comparative analysis of Husserl and Levinas's concepts of subjectivity, sensibility and common time. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

The first section of this paper offers a review of accounts of this transformational period, placing opposing theories within the larger framework of the frictions between cultural studies and political economy, and underscores the need for a holistic understanding of the period. The second section chronicles the press's articulation of its new professional tenets, offers a definition of journalistic objectivity, and reveals its intrinsic limitations. The third section details how the modern press's ideal democratic mandate has been compromised, with the influence of the press being used instead to ensconce powerful interests. And the fourth section outlines the calls for a redefinition of journalism in light of the failures covered in the preceding section.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart is offered as an alternative journalistic form that transcends the dangerous dogma of traditional news outlets, allowing it to fulfill the democratic responsibility of the press by encouraging a critical and astute citizenry. <em>cultural studies; democracy; Jon Stewart; journalism; journalistic objectivity; mass media; mass press; news media; political economy; The Daily Show.

Unlike research concerned with bandwidth and traffic growth, this study shifts the risk analysis away from capacity issues to focus on performance standards for interconnection and data reachability. The long-term health of the Internet is framed in terms of "data reachability" – the principle that any end-user can reach any part of the Internet without encountering arbitrary actions on the part of a network operator that might block or degrade transmission. Risks to reachability are framed in terms of both systematic traffic management practices and "de-peering," a more aggressive tactic practised by Tier-1 network operators to resolve disputes or punish rivals. De-peering is examined as an extension of retail network management practices that include the growing use of deep packet inspection (DPI) technology for traffic-shaping. De-peering can also be viewed as a close relative of Net Neutrality, to the extent that both concepts reflect arbitrary practices that interfere with the reliable flow of data packets across the Internet. In jurisdictional terms, however, de-peering poses a qualitatively different set of risks to stakeholders and end-users, as well as qualitatively different challenges to policymakers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is argued here that risks to data unreachability represent the next stage in debates about the health and sustainability of the global Internet. The study includes a detailed examination of the development of the Internet's enabling technologies; the evolution of telecommunications regulation in Canada and the United States, and its impact on Internet governance; and an analysis of the role played by commercialization and privatization in the growth of risks to data reachability. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

The prosthetic relationship of industrial technologies to the body, unlike the contingency of traditional art technologies on the body, problematizes the question of cinema as art. Cinema's capacity to render thought-like environments allows its trans-mediumatic abstraction. This extends its questioning beyond the technologically cinematic, into the pre-technological moving image that animates perception, thought and dream. In scanning the field that makes cinema possible, this work questions the possibilities cinema opens as a way of knowing and assembling realities. The interpolation of language, thought and embodiment reveals a view of language as mediumatic, and of cinema as a linguistic medium that can simulate a cognitively faithful dream (the original disembodied moving image) as sensory experience. Thus cinema re-enacts a pre-technological environment while advancing the language of technology embedded in the cinematic machine. The libidinal ways solar and chthonic energies, the symbolic and the physical, interpolate in mytho-poetic thought, art and science culminate in the ways these energies unfold in the experience of cinema and illuminate human hybridization, from ancient anthropo-bestiality to the techno-human condition. Poetry and reason, as the two ways of language, outline an epistemology that foregrounds the primacy of poetry in symbolic being. This work aims to resolve tensions between the symbolic and the material both theoretically and methodologically, proposing an integration of rational and poetic (artistic) techniques. The methodological intervention brings divergent approaches into tensional dynamic that sculpts a mobile structure, necessarily open-ended and imperfect. Theoretically, it delves into the movements of poetry and reason as ways to meaning, investigating their destination in cinema. The vocabulary of reason prompts cinema to advance a technological intent to colonize reality while poetic language destabilizes that movement. Reason and poetry as the two ways of language are thus actualized in the ways cinematic language interpolates mental and sensory experience. <em>Motion pictures; Philosophy; Motion picture audiences; Psychological aspects; Motion pictures and literature; Motion pictures; Psychological aspects </em></p> </td>

To do so, the work analyzes the performed social identity of Springsteen and its relationship to popular music performance, particularly in terms of understanding and assessing the motivations behind comparisons with Brian Fallon of The Gaslight Anthem, a band frequently though to represent Sprinsteen's influence. Two case studies were conducted to examine the performed personas of both artists, informed by theories of the communication of meaning and identity. Springsteen is found to portray a traditionally American, White, working class male, representative of the idealized image of early American republican philosophy. Alternately, Fallon is found to perform a similar social identity without the significant evocation of this republicanism. Comparisons between these artists are theorized as emerging from their use of similar identity representations and indicators of meaning, particularly in their communication of authenticity. <em>Bruce Springsteen; economic class; masculinity; national identity; performance; physical body; popular music; racialized identity; social identity.

The celebrities analyzed in this thesis including Oprah Winfrey, Paul (Bono) Hewson, and Angelina Jolie, each adopt Western consumerist strategies that are incompatible with the diverse values and worldviews found in Africa. In addition, development giving provides an unsustainable solution for a collective global future, and is not exempt from forms of inequality, dependency, domination, and exploitation that privilege the Western subject through dehumanizing others. <em>Africa; celebrity; Angelina Jolie; celebrity humanitarians; development; humanitarianism; Hollywood; Oprah Winfrey; Paul (Bono) Hewson; Western consumerist strategies.

Issues of modes of masculinity from the rural to the urban, as well as female masculinity are investigated in this sample of varying works of fiction. Grounded in an analysis of the philosophy and fiction of Soren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir, with reference to traditional Bildungsroman (coming-of age, or education novel), I hope to have demonstrated the similar, but newly interpreted existential trajectory of self-development in contemporary narrative. This is reflected in postmodern and contemporary narratives that challenge existing conventions while prizing modernist philosophical tenets. Combining theoretical and creative acumen, this work aims to contribute to age and gender studies, while offering a fresh approach to scholarly work. <em>Alistair MacLeod; bildungsroman; existentialism; female masculinity; gender and sexuality studies; masculinity; Michael Chabon; Nick Hornby; postmodernism; rural to urban environments.

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> Research to date on apathy has been limited to the technical spheres of politics, pedagogy, mass media, and business. Contrary to apathy’s characterization in recent scholarship, this work claims that apathy cannot be understood in terms of a decline in political engagement alone. Through a history of the idea of apathy beginning with the Stoic concept of apatheia, this work locates apathy in the epochal shift in epistemology and subjectivity which occurred between antiquity and modernity, and claims that apathy is a philosophical (rather than political) problem. Guiding research questions include: what allowed for the possibility of modern apathy, and what means might we have at our disposal to address apathy? Rather than treating symptoms, I argue that any response to apathy must engage with its epochal grounding conditions, and so rather than suggesting policy reforms or new legislation, I assess problems accompanying modern subjectivity and epistemology, and the place of the Good under modernity. This project also participates in the longstanding debate concerning the possibility of uniting sense and reason, a problem known in antiquity and addressed by communication theorists and Romantic poets. I argue that the commingling of sense and reason is another way of describing openness to an encounter with the Good, and under modernity such commingling might result from aesthetic exercises. I consider McLuhan and Foucault thinkers whose work can be read as a form of áskēsis that extends the ancient philosophical tradition into modernity in order to encourage spiritual work in the present. Through readings of McLuhan and Foucault’s engagement with antiquity, I then suggest that aesthetic exercises arising out of the modern milieu may offer a response to apathy and its grounding epistemological and subjective conditions. This work attempts to broaden the contemporary understanding of apathy, and to reconnect the discourse on apathy to its grounding conditions – subjective and epistemological sunderings which have been intensified and normalized under modernity. This broadening and reconnection demand that apathy is understood in a more complete way, not simply in terms of its immediate consequences for the technological society. <em>antiquity; áskēsis. modern apathy; modern epistemology; modern subjectivity; sense and reason; The Good.

It suggests that matter is movement. Matter is the movement of time which in its duration is memory and creativity; conservation and action, as well as the moving reorientation of matter spatially through the constant collision between different surfaces of meaning. An investigation of matter through this approach allows for an understanding of matter to be achieved, one in which the material realm plays the steering role in the methodology, not a preconceived agenda which the theorist wishes to exemplify. The outcome is a shared agency between humans and matter, which has neither been found in idealism or materialism, which both Bergson and Latour reject. Bergson's intuition, and Latour's translation and Actor-Network-Theory, are further examined as ways of interpreting the documentary Manufactured Landscapes. <em>Philosophy; religion and theology Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

This category has grown to encompass a multitude of selfies that address ideological statements and concepts through the performance of the selfie-taker. The reigning selfie celebrity, Kim Kardashian-West, represents the term selfie as a shortened version of “selfish,” though she is not alone. Popular media reinforces, through discourse, a cultural association between the selfie and pathologies such as narcissism (Burns, 2015), discounting the complexities of the selfie. Selfies can be political, and feminist; there are examples of women all over the world enacting political and feminist gestures through selfies. These enactments may range from selfies in direct response to government legislation, or in response to theorized socio-cultural values, such as human rights issues or issues of individual identity and self-representation. Arguably an emerging genre, the spectrum of political feminist selfies presents a salient case study of the selfie’s function as an effective medium for performing the body as representation, and as selfie object in order to challenge the female body as a site of oppression. For the purposes of this major research paper, I am particularly interested in how selfidentifying women use the selfie through the practices and technologies 1 of smart phones and social media as a communication tool to challenge oppressive statements and ideologies.(from the introduction) <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

I will explore the context of the city and then present an analysis of a number of its high level strategic planning documents. In this analysis, I chart the influence of three variables within the city’s plans to develop a creative and cultural milieu. The first variable is the economic discourse and logic that stems out of Florida’s creative class thesis. The second variable is the system of social relations that accompanies the creative cities economic framework. This aspect of my paper stems out of the thinking of the Regulation School, who posit that economic discourses and social relationships work together as two dependant variables in a dialectical process of change. The third variable I analyse is the system of spatial relations that both determine and are determined by the social relations of the creative class discourse. This aspect of my paper follows the work of postmodern Marxist geographers like Lefebvre, Harvey, Soja, and Dear, who argue that social relationships and spatial relationships act as dependant variables in a dialectical process of change. I then provide a theoretical synthesis by combining all three dependant variables and demonstrating how economic frameworks, social relationships, and spatial relationships influence one another in a dynamic process of cultural planning and change. My hypothesis is that the city can positively influence its cultural growth in two ways: first, by shaping the physical development and layout of its downtown core (its spatial relations), and second by influencing the character and nurturing the development of the city’s cultural organizations (the social relations). Following my theoretical framework, I posit that the city can influence its social and spatial relations in a way that will produce socially just changes to the economic aspects of cultural life in Mississauga. My analysis will provide evidence for the roles that all three variables play in the city’s cultural development plans. By situating this analysis within the context of culturally led development in the 21st century, I will also demonstrate how Mississauga’s application of culturally led development is tailored to the needs of its residents and businesses. This project will therefore act as a stepping stone for future research into the lives and experiences of Mississauga’s cultural organizations and residents.

Of a moment where it feels like the order of the world is shifting under our feet, where things are growing and decaying, where things seem to be changing, but it's not exactly clear how, where there is some kind of crisis, one that we can only name pieces of, where everything we do only seems to make it worse, and it's not clear if anything can be done. The project is made from digital video images shot in Bejing in December 2005 to June 2006, spoken-voice stories about the city, and questions about larger world relations. The stories are told from the perspective of a person from the US living in China. She knows Beijing, and speaks Mandarin. Together, these images and words, English, Mandarin, and sounds of the city, form a rhythmic poem, 42 minutes long. In the tradition of Chinese poetry, the film speaks through concrete images and examples. It is dense, and covers many topics: I want the film to lead people to talk, think and ask questions about the world at this moment, and our roles in it. <em>Beijing; business; politics; China; economic growth; film; globalization; politics; standards of living; United States.

By doing so, this paper contributes to the debate about what, if anything, the internet has changed for the social lives of urban Canadians and for the ways Canadians might think about their interactions with internet technology. Have the technical capabilities of the internet (its facilitation of instant communication over long distances, its information storing ability, its visual interface) introduced new practices into culture? New ways of thinking about our everyday culture? As well, how are our activities, and the system of capitalism in which we live, shaping the development of the internet itself? I approach this paper from an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing on a wide range of theory and thinking from communication studies, sociology, cultural studies, and science studies. This literature assists me in understanding the relationship between internet technologies and everyday culture, particularly our daily social interactions. I also draw significanly on the situationist thinking of sociologist Erving Goffman, whose focus on the situatedness of interaction and social meaning assist in an understanding of the way that internet technology becomes important for a rangeof specifically-situated interactions. As Carey points out, "Advances in our understanding of culture cannot be secured unless . they are tied to a vivid sense of technology and social structure" (Carey 1989 p. 64). Conversely, advances in our understanding of technology must view it as an iteration of culture intimately connected to social structure. The range of theory upon which I draw in this project helps form and inform these connections. In particular, Goffman's work is helyful because of its focus on the particularity of social interactions and their 3 relationships to cultural codes and to everyday objects. Therefore, we must consider not just the "effects" of a technology, but also the meanings that we attach to that technology as we shape it and as it becomes part of our culture. We must look also at the social and philosophical qualities of the adoption of new technology, and the way that people's relationships with that technology influence their relationships with others in the social milieu, with the places and spaces they inhabit, and in short with culture in general.

In my reading of horror, it is not just one genre among many in contemporary popular culture. Rather, it is a privileged literary and aesthetic discourse with roots traceable to the cultural moments associated with the beginning of the Modern Era in the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. From this perspective, horror's unique position in modern culture comes from its insistence on the centrality of mystery, wonder and the supernatural in the face of the overwhelming disenchantment characteristic of modern life. Film theory tells us that close reading of popular texts can provide valuable insights into a society's collective attitudes, assumptions, hopes, and fears. My discussion of recent horror films, drawing upon extensive knowledge of the genre's history and imagery, reveals how the popularity of the supernatural in the mass media today relates to the cross-pressures of life in the secular age identified in the work of Charles Taylor. <em>Religion; Mass communications; Film studies; Philosophy; religion and theology; Communication and the arts; Enlightenment; Horror genre; Industrial Revolution; Modern Era; Secular Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

In Canada there exists a "myth of superabundance" within both the government and public psyche which has driven profligate and unsustainable water use. Jurisdictional fragmentation, pollution and the potential for bulk water transfers threaten Canadian water. With a lack of a cohesive federal policy for water, Canadian water is at risk. At its root this, like all resource management, is a cultural problem. Any solutions to this seemingly intractably complex problem are ultimately social in origin and rest on a paradigm shift in resources management in the country. Historical examples are employed to contextualize the situation. The move to the "soft-path" management of water with concomitant reduction of reliance on infrastructure to reduce pressures is addressed.

Taking a lead from Georg Simmel, the thesis defines four aspects of the social type called "the taxpayer": (1) taxpayers owes their existence to the tax system; (2) taxpayers are utilitarian and interested in serving themselves; (3) taxpayers are powerless because they are dominated by the tax system; (4) taxpayers' desire for personal freedom motivates them to subvert the tax system. The theoretical discussion is supplemented with a discourse analysis of commentaries published by the National Taxpayers Union (NTU). Finally, this thesis situates the discourse mode of taxpayers within a broader social context (such as the 2404 U.S. Presidential debates) and identifies how the taxpayer's style of argument is replicated in discussions having nothing to do with taxation. <em>Social sciences Media and Culture;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Bruce Elder</p> <p><strong>Dissertation:</strong> This dissertation investigates a possible approach of dealing with experimental cinema. Film studies does not provide a framework for understanding the form and elements that comprise experimental films, for it mostly focuses on the content and narrative structure. The fundamental question that this dissertation takes up is how might one deal with films whose form mirrors the experience of the body? The broader contours of this dissertation explore the diminishing role of the human body in the digital age. It investigates the central place of the body in art and, ultimately, in all human experience. This dissertation adopts two means in developing the framework for considering experimental cinema and, its related counterpart, the diminishing role of the body and of the real experience amidst the thrust of technological progress. The first approach concentrates on the phenomenological body, a body as given in the immediacy of experience, and relies on the philosophy of Luce Irigaray and Maurice Merleau-Ponty in describing the experience involved in making art. The second explores the psychoanalytic conception of the body, a body propelled by its internal energies and their repressed traces, and turns to Sigmund Freud, Julia Kristeva and Anton Ehrenzweig, focusing on the role of the body and the primary process thinking in the art of the avant-garde. The theoretical positions explored in this dissertation permit the assertion that the human body is the source of and site of resistance in the culture of technological progress and technical thinking. Furthermore, this dissertation argues that those forms of the avant-garde art that explore the human body and strive to affirm its importance in human communication are essentially feminine. It identifies the characteristics of feminine aesthetics in visual art and experimental cinema by relying on the foundation set by the proponents of écriture féminin. It insists that radical art today, in order for it to maintain its generative force, must embody the feminine aesthetics; it must assume characteristics of the repressed feminine. The theoretical framework in this dissertation offers a new perspective in the field of experimental cinema and avant-garde art for future artists and scholars. <em>Modern literature; Fine arts; Film studies; Language; literature and linguistics; Communication and the arts; Avant-garde; Bodily sensations; Experimental cinema; Nude; Poetics of revolt; Self-representation Technology in Practice</em></p> </td>

Margarita Quintana is a Chilean immigrant and a Canadian with a history of social and political activism. She is also a mother, a social worker, a university graduate, a host parent for international students and a psychotherapist in training. Her life is heavily shaped by her upbringing in a working class family in Chile, in a domestically abusive household, and as a surrogate caregiver to her four siblings.

Still, while women continue to make up a trifling percentage of CEOs in Fortune 500 companies, and are continually paid 72% of the wages of their male counterparts, 2 small advances continue to be made by women in both these areas? Yet, one profession that stands out as persistently keeping women on the outside looking in is mainstream filmmaking, especially directing. Indeed, no woman has ever won an Oscar for directing, and women are rarely nominated in the category, most likely because women direct less than 1 % of mainstream films. While women continue to chip their way up the corporate ladder, albeit excruciatingly slowly, women directors of mainstream films are actually declining in numbers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is ironic that it should be in the area of filmmaking that women have made such small progress. The implication of feminist film criticism's rifts and divisions, played out in theories of heterogeneity or what makes up a feminist aesthetic, typifies the continuing contribution that feminist criticism has made to critical and ultural studies on a whole. Much current critical theory is indebted to feminist film theory, but in tum, critical, psychoanalytic, post structuralist and cultural studies' influences on radical feminist theory have effected--or at least influenced--a shift that tends to privilege a critical practice dealing primarily with image/representation. As a result, feminist approaches to media have centred on '[re]reading' popular culture through a narrow feminist paradigm which in film criticism, especially, has meant that dominant critical strategies chiefly have been limited to a political tactic of "reading against the grain," rather than a tactic of producing contemporary feminist films.--Pages 2-3 <em>activism; aestheticism; feminism; feminist film theory; film criticism; mainstream films; One Way Or Another (movie); Sally Potter; Sara Gomez; Thriller (movie); women’s cinema; visual culture theory; women directors.

Children are asked both implicitly and explicitly to identify with animals, but then to position themselves as distinctly human through the mode of their interactions with both lived animals and those depicted in literature and film. This core question of identity formation – child/adult, animal/human – forms the foundation of my dissertation, which investigates the overlapping, double-sided rhetorics addressing children, childhood and animals. My dissertation is organized into five areas of interest that pose complementary questions regarding the way in which relationships between animals and children inform and underscore adults’ lived relationships with both of them. Posthumanist scholarship, then, becomes a key means by which to de-prioritize a conception of an exclusively human subjectivity. Cary Wolfe in particular has recently worked to criticize liberal humanism and find ways to push cultural analysis beyond its inherent anthropocentrism in order to combat institutionalized speciesism, which continues to prioritize human beings, thereby excusing the exploitation or extermination of other species. What has been notably overlooked in posthumanism’s challenge to anthropocentric human liberalism, however, is how the human is encultured through literature geared specifically towards a child audience. By examining culturally significant and widely popular works of children’s culture through a posthumanist, or animality studies lens, I argue that Western philosophy’s objective to establish a notion of an exclusively human subjectivity is continually countered in the very texts that ostensibly work to configure human identity. Literature geared toward a child audience reflects and contributes to the cultural tensions created by the oscillation between upholding and undermining the divisions between the human and the animal. My dissertation focuses on the ways in which these works present the boundary between humans and animals as, at best, permeable and in a state of continual flux. <em>animals; animal bodies; animality studies; anthropomorphized animal; child audience; children’s literature; human identity; identity formation; posthumanism.

Drawing from gray and scholarly literature alongside four semi- structured interviews and three action research methods, this research shows that smart cities and technologies are the latest iteration of corporate power, exploitation, and control. Imbued with neoliberal, colonial, and positivistic logics, the smart city risks further eroding democracy, privacy, and equity in favour of promoting privatization, surveillance, and an increased concentration of power and wealth among corporate and state elite. While the publicized promise of the smart city may continuously shift to reflect and co-opt oppositional narratives, its logics remain static, and its beneficiaries remain few. Applying a social justice-oriented lens which connects critical theory, postmodernism, poststructuralism, intersectional feminism, and anti- colonial methodologies is crucial in reconceptualizing “smartness” and prioritizing public good. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Recent scholars have noted ways in which the prostitute was routinely depicted as a threat and victim in nineteenth-century institutional discourse. This thesis complicates these readings by examining the construction of the fallen woman in commercial imagery. Far from depicting the streetwalker as a source of pity and disease, commercial culture redefined the image of the prostitute as a source of ambiguous visual pleasure. This allowed the signifiers of prostitution to extend through pornographic representation, entertainment advertisements, actress pin-ups and fashion magazines. Making illicit female sexuality a readily consumable pleasure, however, ultimately fostered greater efforts on the part of authorities to push prostitutes back into invisibility. <em>Sex role in advertising; Great Britain; History; 19th century; Prostitutes; Great Britain; History; 19th century; Prostitutes in art </em></p> </td>

As the following paper will elaborate, inspired by Marshall McLuhan’s assertion that the medium is the message, the Mapathy project is a series of web-based maps which depict voter turnout in Canadian federal elections since 1993. Presenting the voter turnout data on maps is meant to visualize the decline in voter turnout that has been witnessed during the past quarter century, often attributed to the increasing apathy of Canadians electors. The following paper will outline the scope of the Mapathy project, followed by a review of existing literature and an overview of the project’s theoretical framework. The literature review begins with an examination of voter turnout in the Canadian context and potential causes of the increasingly low levels of voter turnout being witnessed at Canadian federal elections. These potential causes will be further examined in the following sections which investigate the relationships between both age and political interest to one’s likelihood of voting. Based on the evidence presented by the proceeding research, the subsequent section will review various strategies that have been suggested to address the unique cohort of young Canadians today, followed by an overview of the methodology I have used in creating the Mapathy project.

Governments have developed initiatives to enable broadband in these areas, including the federal Broadband for Rural and Northern Development (BRAND) and the provincial Connect Ontario: Broadband Regional Access (COBRA) programs. Here, BRAND and COBRA's abilities to extend publicly available broadband throughout rural and northern parts of Canada are evaluated as universal servive policies according to the perceptions of stakeholders concerned with their implementation, finding that the programs ultimately fail. While BRAND and COBRA both purport to support universal connectivity and national parity by subsidizing broadband connectivity in non-market regions, the goals of market liberalization and global competitiveness constantly overpower. While the former goals require ongoing support, the programs actually serve to facilitate the establishment of market determined broadband in profitable regions through the provision of one-time funding. <em>Minority &amp; ethnic groups; Sociology; Mass media; Communication and the arts; Social sciences Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

The emphasis on place in world cinema—whether through considerations of contemporary urbanism, the pervasive experience of borders and border crossings, or the negotiation of local history—calls attention to a multitude of anxieties about globalization. I argue that filmmakers have responded to the disjunctive experiences and representations of globalization by calling attention to place as a provisional and indeterminate field. Rather than representing place as a closed system, recent world cinema provides a cartographic approach to place which draws on the medium's indexical claims to the material world and the textual indeterminacy of the cinematic image. My theoretical framework draws on cultural geography's recent reassessment of space as a dynamic and relational concept and film studies' longstanding interest in film's indexical relation to the world as a marker of its specificity. My case studies include works by recent filmmakers who have sought to provide alternative representations of the social and cultural dynamics of globalization to dominant models of global-local relations. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

The history of queer representation is laden with violence, erasure and shame, as well as survival and persistence. I approach this legacy by bringing together three principal topics that I argue are closely related: queer photographic practices, the politics of the archive, and affect theory. Through the analysis of social conditions that formed discourses of homosexuality and industrialism’s development of photography in the late nineteenth century, the tension between oppressive laws and social change becomes clear: it reveals a cultural crisis of taxonomy and representation in queer visual history. The slippages between cultural economy and representation are exemplified in nineteenth century visual culture as political economy was increasingly entwined with the individual and the state. Out of this matrix comes the advent of photography. Inexpensive and accessible mechanical reproduction made it possible for the apparatus of photography to be both complicit in the categorization and repression of homosexuality, as well as a site of subversion of the status quo. Conventions in portraiture photography inscribed the construction of normativity through ‘the cult of the empire,’ yet queer subjectivities challenged these standards. A number of specific case studies involving women photographers and photographic subjects – such as Mabel Hampton, Bonnie and Semoura Clark, Alice Austen, and found photographs from my personal collection illustrate a symbolic defiance to hegemonic structures. By investigating archival material with a specific focus on queer history and photography, the case studies illustrate how our affective lives are saturated with political meaning. Photography wields unusual power when examining the relationship between affect and feeling. The affect of photography derives from its insistence on the past. Yet, photography produces a here and now that can resist strictures of heteronormativity and patriarchy through politicized feelings. The approach to queer historization is firmly rooted in notions of social justice imperatives and anti-oppressive political strategies that include racism, gender inequality and classism. Queer archives evoke cultural persistence and knowledge through the affective context of remembering. <em>Archives; Photography; Queer History; Affect Theory; and Phenomenology. </em></p> </td>

I interrogate how it can be effectively utilised for the purposes of art criticism, particularly in tandem with McLuhan's notion of the 'counter-environment', and in relation to music and musical multi-media in particular. I also give outline to the affect-script theory of Silvan Tomkins, demonstrating how others might use Tomkin's work in the decoding of musical communication. In part one I explore the 'concept album' and its application to Radiohead's work, along with Ok Computer's relation to the genre of science fiction. I provide background to what Neil Postman (1992) outlines as Technopoly, and begin my illustration of how Ok Computer functions as a counter-environment to the cultural conditions that Postman describes. Part two explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man as the anti-hero, all of which associate him with invective feelings and violent activity. 'Paranoid Android' connects the phenomenon of information overload to Technopoly, and to its eclipsing of the traditional world-view. The song also portrays our protagonist's intolerance and scapegoating tendencies which I relate to the mimetic theory of René Girard. Part three explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man in his heroic mode, beginning with 'Subterranean Homesick Alien', which highlights his estrangement from nature, and the unintended consequences of his technological extensions upon himself, his fellow species, and his habitat.While elucidating Technopoly's connection to the technology of money, I illustrate how Ok Computer's final song – 'The Tourist' – expresses Cosmic Man's self-critique at the individual and the cultural level. <em>Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Musical communication; Radiohead; Technopoly; Cultural anthropology; Music Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

My decision to take advantage of the project option has been an excellent and enlightening method to deal with some of these issues, but also has its own limitations. For the first part of this project I have written a novella in which I introduce and dramatize the discourse by raising some of these questions in a metafictional way within the story itself. In the second part, I discuss these same issues from a theoretical perspective, as a meditation incorporating mainly Literary and Communications Theory and Philosophy. In the third and final part, I attempt to create a synthesis of the first two parts by combining narrative and theoretical elements with an explanation of some of the thoughts and ideas I, as author of the piece, was trying to get across to the reader through character, action, symbolism, etc. <em>authorship; cognitive narratology; communications theory; cultural studies; ethics; literary theory; moral philosophy; publishing; publishing rights.

With access to technologies, such as the internet and digital film and photography, and websites, such as Youtube.com, the average citizen is now able to actively participate in the world of celebrity and even turn themself into a celebrity figure. The world of celebrity (online, at least) has become do-it-yourself and has, in many ways, democratized the process of fame. Through the rise in online readership and recognition, even the creators of online tabloids have themselves become celebrities and active members in the star system they seek to critique. This thesis will demonstrate that the technologies used to demystify the celebrity through perpetual surveillance have, at the same time, succeeded in turning ordinary people into celebrities, thus placing them squarely within the star system they never intended to inhabit. <em>Subculture; Celebrities; Celebrities in mass media; Sensationalism in journalism </em></p> </td>

This paper looks more deeply into structural impediments to ethical behaviour on the part of media workers and the corporations that employ most of them. It begins with an exploration of the sources and meaning of morality, proposing a ‘critical moral realism’ that denies moral relativism but accepts as inevitable the fact of moral relativity, as well as suggesting the possibility of ‘absolute’ moral values. It proposes that the scientific Rationalist underpinnings of market capitalism and the modern business corporation define lines of moral responsibility in ways that tend to obscure, rather than clarify, ethical issues. The modern business corporation is examined in detail from historical, legal, and ethical perspectives, in its role as legal person, employer of media professionals, and source of virtually all commercial information and entertainment media. It is proposed that, the business corporation as defined can, in a metaphorical sense, usefully be theorized as a cybernetic machine that tightly controls the decisions of its nominal human managers. It therefore exists outside conventional human ethical frames of reference, which accounts for its frequently ‘sociopathic’ behavior. This machine-like character makes highly problematic the legal fact of personhood and the access to the protections of human rights codes recently granted to corporations. Corporations benefit from many of the rights of human citizens but are in a position to—are in fact designed to—avoid many of the legal and moral responsibilities of citizenship. It is proposed that corporate, rather than human, needs and goals are responsible for the evolution of both the consumer ethic and the work ethic, and that current neo-liberal ‘enterprise culture’ ideology is a further expression of corporate influence in society. The paper concludes with an examination of the ethical relevance of professional and corporate ‘codes of ethics’ and some tentative approaches to ethical behaviour in contemporary mass media. <em>Communication and the arts; Corporation; Ethics; Information media; Market capitalism; Twenty-first century </em></p> </td>

These misconceptions stem from the relatively unknown rules and regulations that pharmaceutical companies work within. Because of the importance of this topic and the prevalence of misconceptions about it, it is important to gain a greater insight into the pharmaceutical industry’s commercial practices in order to digest their messages appropriately and make the right treatment decisions as consumers. This does not just include understanding its current practices and regulation, but how it has evolved over time. This study aims to provide greater insight into the history of pharmaceutical advertising and the regulation of its commercial practices in North America. It will demonstrate that as healthcare and pharmaceutical advertising has had a long history of selling wellness, regulations and government monitoring has developed to ensure a balanced message. At the core of the matter is the concept of products as “satisfiers” – pharmaceutical companies framing their products as solutions to our desires of well-being and health. Jackson Lears’s concept of “therapeutic ethos” is utilized to delve deeper into the actions of the primary consumers (patients and healthcare professionals) and examine the effects of this type of advertising on their treatment and healthcare decisions. Tracing this concept of selling wellness back to its earliest, non-regulated days up to modern day celebrity endorsements of prescription medication, the study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the pharmaceutical industry and its practices through the use of real-world examples and case studies. <em>&nbsp;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Barring widely shared concerns regarding the exposure of underage children to material deemed inappropriate, newly rebranded “classification” boards have acted to limit the extent to which they themselves can prohibit images from entering the public market, shifting their emphasis away from censorship and toward consumer edification and greater consideration of artistic merit and authorial intent. Such reform brought the policies of censorship boards in Britain, Canada, and Australia into closer alignment with the goals and processes of the Motion Picture Association of America’s ratings system. Can we then assume that cinematic censorship is effectively a thing of the past? Does the impetus to regulate and police film content continue silently to exist? Analysis of controversies surrounding particular films throughout and in the wake of this shift suggests that, while no longer practiced explicitly by governmental institutions, film censorship continues to operate through less immediately recognizable forms of cultural marginalization and restraint. Classification status drastically affects the number of platforms through which a film can be accessed and thus works, as censorship does, to restrict films from audiences. When market demands place external restraints upon film content, familiar processes of cinematic censorship can be reframed as operating within (as opposed to upon) the institutional structures and practices of cultural production. This two-part study will examine, first, the process by which certain postmillennial cinematic artworks, such as Catherine Breillat’s Fat Girl (2001) and Gaspar Noé’s Irreversible (2002), spurred reform in the policies of classification boards by highlighting the rigidity of classification criteria and, secondly, cases in which, following the shift from moral to covert censorship, artistically serious films such as Vincent Gallo’s The Brown Bunny (2003) and Abel Ferrara’s Welcome to New York (2014) have been suppressed or constrained for their challenging subject matter, most notably for their aggressive presentation of sexuality. The main objective will be determining: 1) how the shift from censorship to classification corresponded to the aesthetic strategies of a handful of boundary-pushing films; and 2) how cinematic censorship, in the absence of traditional institutional enforcement, continues to operate in the interactions between alternative networks of disciplinary power and discursive practice. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Most notably defined by the film theorist André Bazin as “objectivity in time” (14), it not only allows for a reproduction of the real world, a visual capturing of objects in front of the camera, but it also has the distinct capacity to capture sounds and images in real time. Unlike music, which is generally deemed non-representational, film, by its very definition, reproduces what lies in front of the camera and thus supposedly re-presents it. The French philosopher, Jean-Luc Nancy, however, redefines this logic of representation whereby film could be thought as merely a reproduction of a pre-existing reality. Nancy thinks of art not in terms of representation but of presentation, as the exhibition of worldly existence. Cinema is understood here not as a copy or an imprint with an indexical relation to reality, but rather as presentation of the real in its singular plurality.As Ian James notes in “Jean-Luc Nancy: The Infinity of Sense,” Nancy’s philosophy is primarily associated with French post-structuralism and Derridean deconstruction (81). Yet, Nancy’s thinking diverges from that of Derrida’s early on, particularly in regards to his conception of singular-plurality, finitude, sense, and the world (81). While Nancy is best known for his writings on community, he has actively engaged with the question of art and aesthetics since mid 1990s and has written prolifically on painting, film, sculpture, installation art, and literature. Such publications as The Muses (1996), The Ground of the Image (2005), and Multiple Arts: the Muses II (2006) demonstrate his unwavering interest in writing on art and aesthetics. This paper will explore Nancy’s understanding of cinema in light of his writings on art and aesthetics, which stem from and are closely related to his wider philosophy on the ontology of sense, singular plurality, and that of technology. As mentioned previously, Nancy rejects any notion of art as representational or mimetic, arguing instead that “the objects of art do not depend on phenomenology… because they are prior to the phenomenon itself” (The Muses 33). In other words, for Nancy, art does not reproduce the exterior appearance of phenomena nor can it be regarded as a representation of abstract ideas; rather the forms and images of art, being prior to phenomenon itself, facilitate a sort of opening onto to the sense of the world. He writes: “Art isolates or forces the moment of the world as such, the being-world of the world” (18). Similarly, Nancy regards cinema not in terms of representation, but as presentation of worldly existence. With the evidence of its images facilitating an access to the sense of the world, Nancy contends, film emphasizes an ethical, expository look revealing existence as always co-existence. In what follows I will explore Nancy’s writing on film, most notably on Abbas Kiarostami, also considering Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s Once Upon a Time in Anatolia as a compelling example of a film corresponding to Nancy’s theory of cinema. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

An Analysis of the Narrative Portrayals and Ideologies of Romantic Love in the Neo-Traditional Romantic Comedy</strong><br> Rakhee Sapra (2012); Supervised by Carmen Schifellite</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper:</strong> Romantic love has been, and continues to be, the subject of diverse discussions in a variety of realms, including but not limited to, philosophy, psychology and anthropology. Despite the depth and range of such discussions, as a concept, romantic love remains an enigmatic phenomenon. Love may be knowable and comprehensible to others, as understood in the phrases, "I am in love", "I love you", but it is often felt, most notably by the humanities academic community, that what "love" means in these sentences cannot be analyzed further. This is because the concept of "love" is perceived to be irreducible; an axiomatic, or self-evident, state of affairs that warrants no further intellectual intrusion. In attempting to define love therefore, we stumble across the philosophical questions of how we may know love, how we may understand it and whether it is possible or plausible to make statements about being in love if love is purely an emotional condition. In light of these concerns it is necessary to assert that there is a difference between the claim that love cannot be examined and the claim that it should not be subject to examination out of a sense of reverence for its mysteriousness, its awesome, divine, or romantic nature. <em>cinema; film; Hollywood; love; love narratives; neo-traditional comedy; popular culture; romantic comedy; romantic love; social ideologies; textuality.

The techniques of institutional audience research reflect and "infect" the range of discussion, policy creation and broadcast programming that result.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Original research was conducted in 2005 through in-depth interviews with thirty key participants at the intersection of broadcasting, policy and audience research. The data and insights from those interviews were analyzed in conjunction with public policy documents and a range of otherwise unavailable institutional audience research. Using these data points, the role of audience research was then analyzed in the developments around two policy case studies: (1) the evolution of performance indicators at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; and, (2) Canadian TV drama funding criteria and the debate over "CanCon".</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An original "Audience Massage" model is proposed as a means of examining the various levels of audience discourse in policy formation. It involves three levels of analysis: (1) Rhetorical–with attention on the content of audience research; (2) Framing–with attention to the "media" of research generation, in particular the dominance of certain key quantitative methodologies; and, (3) Structural–with attention to the discourse as it is supported by certain dominant research institutions that are integrated into larger broadcasting systems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The model allows the researcher to look beyond the surface meanings of individual audience research study results to expose at a deeper level the discursive language of audience; the frames that result from certain formal characteristics of audience research methodologies as they have developed over time. These methodological frames set constraints upon what the type of research is conducted and indeed the possible conceptualization of audience in the broadcasting policy field. In turn, framing of audience is organized within institutional research systems that are part of the larger political and economic structures of broadcasting and public policy in Canada. <em>Canadian studies; Public administration; Mass media; Communication and the arts; Social sciences; Audience; Broadcasting; Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; Policy; Television Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

In doing so, we will see that Ontario has a long and storied history of using tuition to ensure that universities are largely undifferentiated from one another. While this lack of differentiation is important at the level of tuition setting, it means that many of our universities are offering the same courses and programs with little or no variation between institutions. In the eyes of the provincial policy makers, this produces redundancies and fails to reflect the dynamic labour market that Ontario’s university students must hope to compete in. I will here begin with an overview of the history of tuition setting and program development in Ontario’s universities, beginning with the 1940s and describing the relationship between the public university and provincial government. I will present the Strategic Mandate Agreements (SMA) in terms of being an important step on the road to differentiation, despite their relative ineffectiveness and empty rhetoric. Moreover, I will be arguing the case that differentiation is important to the continued survival of the neoliberal university system in Ontario. I will also examine the roots of the differentiation project, outlining how it came to be. In this way, I will argue that the neoliberal university model, as it currently stands in Ontario, needs to differentiate itself in order to continue to thrive. I will now put differentiation into the context of the history of the Ontario public university system. (from the introduction) <em>&nbsp;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

These communities are essential in insuring a film studio that there are very active audiences that will pay for a ticket in order to judge for themselves how successful the adaptation is. In the process, these fan communities simultaneously become responsible for the creation of mythologies while also taking pleasure in experiencing them, pitting their allegiances towards the mythopoetic against the logic of commodification. A logical case study to use in this compendium is The Lord of the Rings, an assemblage of multiple products and texts adapted from a narrative trilogy written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Since its publication, it has achieved a cultural iconic status within a culture that embraces the gray zone, appealing to audiences in search of a cerebral comic book to those who seek comfort in a reinforcement of the good versus evil trope.&nbsp; <em>audience; commodification; consumer culture; contemporary film industry; fan communities; identity politics; Lord of the Rings; myth; popular culture; postmodernism.

Many of these projects, however, can often lead to increased poverty, conflict and insecurity in communities near the mines. There have also been egregious violations of human rights and grave environmental damages documented at Canadian mines worldwide. As a result, numerous countries in the Americas and beyond have seen burgeoning grassroots resistance movements rejecting the presence of Canadian extractive projects on their territory — movements that are almost invariably rejected as illegitimate by industry and Canadian government representatives, and almost always repressed by host country governments. Using critical discourse analysis and Foucault’s work on governmentality and biopower, this dissertation argues that discourses of democracy and development are increasingly being used to advance projects that are often fundamentally anti-democratic, destructive and exploitative, and that this represents a critical component of a nascent strategy by which neoliberal regimes of capital accumulation are advanced and legitimized today. Through discursive construction of Canadian mining regimes as purveyors of collective “development,” and strategic delegitimization of critics of Canadian mining activities as irrational, radical, dangerous threats to the betterment of society at large, support for the mine is galvanized and conflict surrounding the mine intensifies. This argument is grounded in exploration of three case studies: two open-pit gold/silver mines owned/operated by Goldcorp — their Honduran San Martín mine and their Guatemalan Marlin mine — and the politics of land claims near a non-functioning Guatemalan nickel mine previously owned by Canada’s Skye Resources and HudBay Minerals. Further evidence for this argument is offered in two accompanying documentary films that I have produced, exploring these particular case studies. In demonstrating how foot soldiers are being enlisted into an army that defends the interests of Canadian mining companies and the neoliberal economic order that they proliferate and prosper from — despite the fact that local benefits may be negligible and the harms incurred can be severe — this dissertation seeks to shed light upon a broader dynamic of resistance/counter-resistance playing out globally in areas beyond resource extraction. <em>Social responsibility of business; Canada; Mineral industries; Honduras; Mineral industries; Guatemala; Protest movements; Guatemala; Protest movements; Honduras; Critical discourse analysis; State; The Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Widely credited as the first ‘Blockbuster,’ and one of the first films to establish Hollywood narrative techniques and conventions, D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film, Birth of A Nation, is an epic melodrama about the American Civil War ending with a literal marriage of the North and the South in the form of a young white heterosexual couple, solidifying the connection between war, families, and nation-building that has become the framework of the genre; hetero-nuclear families are the basis of the nation and war is a threat to these families, but ultimately also a critical component of nation-building/strengthening. These ideologies persist in contemporary combat films. The First Gulf War and those in Iraq and Afghanistan have had a major impact on this genre and this project investigates the (sometimes radical) shifts in representations of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, and nationality in popular Hollywood combat films made and released since the first Gulf War (1990) with a particular emphasis on more recent films (2005-2015) since these are the films which have received the least, if any, scholarly attention. Building on existing cultural, feminist, film, and postcolonial theory using a case study of selected popular Hollywood combat films and based primarily upon close textual analysis of the films themselves, this dissertation argues that these post-Cold War combat films are vital in creating and reinforcing cultural scripts about gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, nationality, and war. This analysis adds to the field by identifying key cycles in the genre and arguing that, in fact, the ideologies of these films whether intentionally or not, reinforce the idea of a white, American, male-headed household as the norm to be protected, removing ‘Others’ from the frame, and implying that war is somehow natural, unending, and/or unavoidable, thereby creating a self-fulfilling prophesy wherein the more it happens, the more we seek to represent it, to gain mastery over it, the more natural and unavoidable it seems, and the more it continues to happen and seem normal and on and on into perpetuity. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

From the oral tradition of Socrates and Plato, through the development of the Phoenician alphabet and Gutenberg's printing press, through the rise of the public school during the Industrial Revolution, and through the many inventions of the twentieth century, education has been an intersection of social practices, technological innovation, and competing ideological visions about children, learners, and what constitutes knowledge. Today's educational landscape is no different, with educators confronting the many challenges of globalization, diasporic cultures, and, the focus of this study, rapidly advancing digital technologies. It is my intention to use the pronouncements and initiatives of the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC) to examine the ideologically-determined possibilities envisioned for emerging technologies. To this end, the CMEC will not serve as an exhaustive case study but rather as an example of how high level, heavily politicized policy choices are and will profoundly affect the structure, if not the very existence, of elementary and secondary public schooling in Canada. I will argue that the CMEC is an increasingly powerful coordinator on national pedagogical questions and is part of a broader trend towards privileging neoliberalist principles. Operating on both a contradictory and deterministic philosophy, I will argue that neoliberalism, embodied by the Council, is leading public education down the road not to a future where the liberal arts, individual needs and market criterion are balanced but rather to a more centralized, homogenizing, and weaker system which prizes economic utility over democratic virtues and individual growth. Further, not only is the position of the CMEC deeply paradoxical but, in the end, neither educational future it offers-radically child-centredness nor the hyper-competitiveness fostered by its policy initiatives-is in fact desirable."--Pages 1-2. <em>Canada; Councils of Ministers of Education Canada (CMEC); digital information and communication technology (ICT); education; elementary schools; globalization; national pedagogy; neoliberalism; pedagogy; public education.

Through an analysis of a representative popular media text of the second wave -- the 1975 film The Stepford Wives -- this project establishes how the female body was conceptualized philosophically and ideologically by the radical feminists of this era. This is then compared to an analysis of the film's recent remake and several other contemporary media texts in order to illustrate how today's popular discourse of "postfeminism" presents a contradictory conception of feminism and its relationship to the body. Finally, this thesis suggests that postfeminist discourse is problematic for its erasure of structural gender inequality and argues that the preservation of a consciousness of sociohistorical context is vital to the perpetuation of a well-grounded feminist cultural critique. <em>Feminism and mass media; Stepford wives (Motion picture : 1975); Stepford wives (Motion picture : 2004); Feminine beauty (Aesthetics) in motion pictures; Second-wave feminism; Feminist theory; Evaluation </em></p> </td>

The myth signals colonial power as it operates in the day-to-day and exposes the state of settler impermanence on Indigenous lands. The first chapter concerns the construction of colonial history and myth making within which the settler myth of the Maid of the Mist draws meaning as a sexually-charged figure of racial difference. The region's colonial historiography reveals a desire to construct Aboriginal peoples as "savage." Following this, I offer an analysis of colonial representational and border politics. The systematic vanishing of the settler myth of the Maid of the Mist and the alienation of Aboriginal people from settler border places normalizes the colonial representational relationship as it buttresses settler borders against the threatening "Indian" Other.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next chapter confronts the settler popular cultural invocation of violence and militancy used to disavow responsibility for colonization in order to argue that love is a method of identifying and challenging systemic violence which imperils the relationship between settler and Native, embodied in the Covenant Chain of Silver and Gus Wen Tah (or Two Row Wampum). I set these representational politics against the lived experiences of violence against community and specifically against women.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next chapter debates the colonial politics of treaty-making and attempts to rescue Treaty from colonial nation-building practices, resuscitating the understanding of Treaty in Indigenous political philosophies. I am also concerned with the profound ontological dissonance between Indigenous and settler perceptions of home, belonging and community in Native spaces that have been recast as settler spaces. I therefore argue that the settler nation must be "unhomed" from Indigenous space.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Borrowing the notion of bridge crossing from Third World feminism and the image of the Fallsview Bridge at Niagara Falls (a bridge which, to the entrepreneurs, tourists and settlers at Niagara Falls, signified "innovation" and the "proper" use of the land), I debate these profoundly divergent notions of home and belonging in the contested space of the settler nation.

Through authentic "murmuring" online, bloggers with socially-marginalized interests chronicle their day-to-day life for public consumption and thereby experience a cathartic release of emotional struggles. Focusing on the ambivalent characteristics of blogs—monological but dialogical—this thesis aims to explore the process of diary blogging through which maladaptive individuals transgress a social taboo on self-destruction. A central argument in this thesis is that murmuring blogs should be examined as performative social activity rather than cognitive reality; unlike conventional diarists, when bloggers document their pent-up feelings, there is always a notion of readers who will observe the writers' personal trajectories of self-disclosure. A series of case studies about a self-destructive blogger in LiveJournal.com reveals how vulnerable bloggers negotiate their identity through an ongoing practice of acting out online with a full use of both personal and public discursive playgrounds. <em>Mass media; Information systems; Communication and the arts Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Taking a departure from a pathologizing tendency among previous studies of SI on the Internet, I have approached this question from the perspective of media studies, exploring how Flickr's interface facilitates and aggregates underrepresented self-expression. The metaphor of skin is used to organize discussions around core components of the subject phenomenon: the corporeal skin of self-injurers, the aesthetic skin of photography, and the skin-interface of social media. This "three-layered skin" is seen to collaboratively produce visual representation of SI on Flickr, allowing participants to engage in a mode of performative self-expression and affective social interaction.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In order to comprehend various channels of communication available on Flickr, this research deploys three lines of inquiry: combining network visualization method to illuminate semantic patterns of metadata, qualitative discourse analysis to explore social interaction among participants, and multimodal content analysis to examine content, component and context of photographic self-expressions. This three-fold mixed method aims to illuminate diverse modes of narrative strategies adopted by the content uploaders when shaping "the photographs of SI" and examines how they represent SI in alignment with, or in opposition to, dominant medical, cultural, and subcultural discourses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The findings reveal that photographic representations of self-injured bodies serve as a modality for a performative self-disclosure that facilitates affective social communication between photo-uploaders and viewers. As the location where SI as one's lived reality meets and collides with various sociocultural assumptions, Flickr photographs symbolize an inextricable relationship between dominant discourses, personal narratives and affective attachments between users and digital imagery. While dominant pathologizing discourses have a significant impact upon the uploaders' self-performance, the analysis illuminates that photographic mode of self-expression enables Flickrists to cultivate new multimodal vocabulary to describe their experience and devise innovative interpretation of the wounds inscribed onto their body. In particular, the aesthetic power of photography allows for interpreting the injured body as an authentic source of self-expression, which transforms painful experience into a powerful narrative of survival and resiliency. <em>Mental health; Web Studies; Information science; Communication and the arts; Health and environmental sciences; Flickr.com; Photographs; Self-injury; Social media; User interface Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

By focusing on this era of dramatic transition, this thesis argues that documentary films have provided Romanians with the tools needed to deal with the past critically. More specifically, the intent of this thesis is to analyze how documentary films do the work of selecting, recollecting, and re-presenting narratives of the past, and to demonstrate that editorial choices resonate with wider social needs. The scope is limited to a short history of the documentary genre, focusing on a detailed analysis of two post-communist documentaries: Memorial of Pain ('Memorialul durerii', 1991), by TV producer Lucia Hossu-Longin and The Great Communist Bank Robbery ("Marele jaf comunist', 2004), by Alexandru Solomon. Ultimately, the thesis traces the ways in which trauma, shame, and amnesia also influence the shaping of both documentaries and identities. <em>Documentary films; Romania; History and criticism; Documentary films; Social aspects; Romania; Great communist bank robbery (Motion picture); Memorial of pain (Motion picture) </em></p> </td>

While speed is politicized in theory, what remains absent is a critical examination and elaboration of the complexity of the cultural politics of time. Time is a site of political possibility and struggle. This project aims to locate the cultural, theoretical, and institutional, discursive and material, responses to speed within a larger cultural politics of time. In the end, I move towards a temporally contingent theory of the public sphere - what I call a power-chronographic theory of the public sphere. The purpose is not to define what time is, or determine if this is or isn't a culture of speed. Instead, I examine the ways in which the cultural, theoretical and institutional response to speed might be locked into a political anatomy of control---one that is biopolitical. I consider how and where time is differentially administered, managed, and conceptualized through various modern institutions of power. Time has becomes a problem at the dinner table, the political public sphere, for soldiers, for business travelers, and yoga instructors alike. At the same time, time also becomes the site at which a tighter structuring and control is exerted over life by diffuse institutions of power. These include the military, the corporation, pharmaceutical companies, nutritionists, airliners, and architects. Furthermore, within this context, there are inequitable and interdependent temporal relations of power that constitute the social fabric. In order to examine the cultural politics of time, I ask two broad but interrelated questions. First I ask, what do the discourses and contemporary cultural and institutional responses to speed tell us about the cultural politics of time? In asking this question, I am examining how the discourses and cultural practices conceive of and alter power relations. The second question asks, what would recognition of a systemic cultural politics of time mean for a theory of the public sphere? <em>Social sciences; Cultural politics; Power-chronography; Speed; Temporality; Sociology Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

The critical approaches of Jacques Derrida and Jurgen Habermas to communication and politics form the basis of this dissertation whose central objective is to problematize Jacques Derrida's philosophical system. I begin by arguing that his political philosophy is not directly entailed by his early work on language, communication, and meaning. I also claim that, taken in its entirety, the theoretical framework Derrida offers does not account for either the processes of meaning and communication, or politics and political life. Moreover, I argue that Jilrgen Habermas' philosophy of language and political theory does offer a complete account of the processes that constitute communication, socio-moral learning, and politics. Habermas, in addition to reconstructing these universal yet detranscendentalized processes, proposes a reimagined historical materialist diagnosis of and remedy to the various pathologies that inhibit the realization of modernity's emancipatory ideals (through a 'counter-discourse of modernity'). I conclude by arguing that Derrida's early deconstructionist technique can and should be incorporated into Habermas' pragmatic system thereby relieving it of its political responsibility, resolving many of its aporias, and making it a useful tool of empancipatory politics. <em>Derrida; Jacques Habermas; Jürgen Political science; Deconstruction </em></p> </td>

Boasting an estimated 18 million unique monthly visitors and generating one million posts per day, the site is a locus of obscenity and bigotry, a wellspring of popular internet culture, and the birthplace of the distributed hacktivist collective known as Anonymous. In contrast to other forms of social media, no registration is required to participate on 4chan, and maintaining a persistent identity is both difficult and discouraged. Although many deride 4chan as puerile or nihilistic, I propose that a nascent form of political expression can be discerned within the site's subculture. Specifically, I explore how participants on 4chan use carnivalesque humour and memetic communication to oster a collective identity and articulate a political orientation towards the internet-summed up by the phrase "the internet is serious business"-while remaining committed to an ethic of radical anonymity. In doing so, I recast participation on 4chan as a political act, albeit one that falls outside of a normative or rational framework. <em>4chan; anonymity; carnivalesque; collective identity; counter discourses; memes; memetic communication; online/offline identities; participation as political action; social media.

The potential of the second-hand economy to positively impact people and the environment, and to foster a healthier relationship with our goods and communities, has just begun to attract focused and extensive scholarly attention. Economist Juliet Schor is at the forefront of this work, evaluating the re-circulation of consumer goods in a 2013 case study on fast fashion. Other scholars from across disciplines have engaged with the second hand economy in a more limited manner, investigating the environmental and social effects of secondary markets, and the motives and attitudes of those who participate in this part of our economy. Scholars from scientific, technological, and social scientific disciplines have directly investigated claims that second-hand economies are less damaging to people and the environment than one-use economies. Notably, environmental scientists have worked to develop quantitative models to assess the environmental impact of a good from production to final disposal. While the majority of these studies substantiate claims that second-hand economies are less damaging to the environment than a one-use economy, claims that second-hand goods are socially beneficial to communities are more difficult to prove. My understanding of the second-hand economy draws on the findings and insight of all these scholars but my emphasis is upon the way second-hand economies could contribute to and figure in scholarly discourses about the potential of existing and emergent economic formations to transform our relationship to our economies, environment and fellow human beings. As I will show, human geographers, historians, economic anthropologists and others have theorized potentially transformative economic formations as sharing economies, moral economies, community economies, solidarity economies, and diverse economies.

These few studies suggest that anonymity, physical disembodiment, and user-content creation contribute to the creative, diverse, and sometimes-deviant quality of avatar sexualities, allowing participants to realize sexual identities and practices otherwise constrained offline. Waskul &amp; Martin (2010) proposed that avatar sexualities are experienced as a 'diffused life,' a combined product of offline and online sexualities. Given the plasticity and diversity of avatar sex noted in previous studies, this research seeks to understand the core concern of avatar sex participants and to theorize processes of variation in avatar sexualities. A grounded theory methodology (Glaser, 1978) was used to structure and theorize data gathered in Second Life through interviews and fieldwork. The findings of this study showed that avatar intimates were compelled by conditions of immersive technological mediation to design personal agency. Briefly, the main statements of the theory of designing agency among avatar intimates evolved in my thesis are: 1. Immersive mediation using Second Life disintegrates features of embodied social agency. Disintegrated agency constitutes the central problem and opportunity for avatar intimates. 2. Designing agency is undertaken to process the central problem and opportunity of disintegrated agency. 3. Designing agency is a personalized process embedded in a network of social, cultural, and technological processes. 4. Designed agency is the evolving gestalt of adaptive variations in the ecology of four action types: affect, conceptualizing, mediating, and performing. These four action types are interdependent. 5. Evaluations of congruence and authenticity motivated the designed variation of agency. These affective evaluations were recursively compared with virtualized performances, relying upon memory and currently held conceptual models. The design of avatar sexualities enrolls participants in an ecology of agency that weaves together communication technologies, conceptual schema, performances, and desire. <em>Cultural anthropology; Social research; Multimedia Communications; Social sciences; Communication and the arts; Avatar; Erotics; Second Life; Sexuality Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

This kind of interpretation accords with Duchamp's own attitudes towards art and chess.

The recent rise in the use of drones in remote territories raises difficult questions surrounding optic asymmetry and the visibilities and invisibilities that characterize their usage. Military drones, by abstracting the target from its larger geographic, political, and social context and framing it through their sightlines and crosshairs, control the aesthetic order in the remote territories within which they operate. Drones distribute and limit metaphysical sensibility within a space by controlling not only which subjects appear, but, more importantly, how they appear. Based on an examination of drone strike footage through the lens of “surveillance aesthetics,” and the concept of “policing,” I will argue that the drone’s omniscient gaze over a largely inaccessible battlefield invites a mediated view of life below which lends itself to the larger tautology of drone warfare, where you are killed because you are a terrorist, and you are a terrorist because you are killed. <em>&nbsp;Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

Quebec case to public. As should be clear, the Chaoulli v. Quebec case was both an extremely important case and an extremely complicated one. As a result, it is important to understand how it was presented to the public. The study was conducted in two parts. First, the specific issues frames expressed by political actors at the Supreme Court hearing were identified and mapped. This was done by examining the transcripts and factums from the hearing and noting the different problem definitions, causal interpretations, suggested remedies, and moral appeals expressed by political actors there (Entman 1993). This review revealed that three distinct specific issues frames were put forth during the hearing by three distinct sets of actors. Next, media coverage of the case was examined. Specifically, media coverage in the Toronto Star, the National Post, the Globe and Mail, and the Ottawa Citizen was examined from the day the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case until six-months after the Supreme Court announced its ruling. Using content analysis, this part of the study identified (1) the presence or absence of the specific issue frames identified in the first part of the study; (2) the type of generic news frames (e.g. the Human Interest Frame) (Semetko and Valkenburg, 2000) used to present the case, and (3) which political actors were directly quoted in coverage of the case. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

I'm also interested in (and to be frank, somewhat anxious since I work in television) what new pitfalls and possibilities the latest technologies pose for the future of television production and distribution in Canada. As we'll lean later, there are technological changes afoot that could sideswipe the effort of generations of Canadian broadcast policymakers and topple the Canadian television industry in their wake. Ours is a fragile television broadcasting system, weakened by a deeply divided policy framework based on two opposing philosophies -- one that puts an emphasis on television's role as a public service and another that emphasizes its commercial purposes and profitability. I will evaluate whether that policy framework is equipped to safeguard Canada's precarious television industry against what some say is an inevitable tidal wave of American domination heading our way. But first I want to investigate whether American domination of our TV sets is such a horror. If television doesn't really matter when it comes to our cultural and national sovereignty, I might as well stop writing right now. But as we'll learn, it does matter. While there is much debate over how television plays a role in our functioning as a sovereign society there is a general consensus that something is happening when we watch TV. It is to the problem of what that something is that I turn to first.-Pages 1-2. <em>Television broadcasting policy; Canada; Television broadcasting; Technological innovations; Canada; Television broadcasting; Social aspects; Canada Politics and Policy</em></p> </td>

This conflict over the morality and legal rights of sex workers is plainly evident in Canada's own treatment of the issue; spanning a period of over twenty-five years, the research and reports on prostitution commissioned by the federal government constitute several thousand pages of empirical evidence documenting the harm caused by the criminalization of prostitution, yet no changes have been made to the country's Criminal Code provisions since 1986. Throughout these government reports and the testimony of dozens of participants in the 2005 hearings held by the country's Subcommittee on Solicitation Laws, the same conflict of language and ideology is repeated; regardless of the time and location, conversations about prostitution within Canada follow an almost predictable pattern of spinning wheels and little progress.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In light of the new opportunity to effect change in Canada's approach to prostitution law, this paper examines the signs and significations evinced in the language of Canada's present laws, and traces the legislative history of sex work in the country as well as the cyclical nature of the observations and conclusions drawn by the many federally-appointed committees charged with addressing the topic. Select witness testimony from hearings conducted by the most recent committee to address the state of prostitution, the Subcommittee on Solicitation Laws, is also reproduced and analyzed. Using the opposing perspectives of victim and rights discourse as a loose framework, particular analytical focus is placed on the language used and ideological beliefs expressed within both the formal reports and testimony. Finally, the core conflicts revealed in Canada's hearings and formal reports on prostitution are placed within a larger body of theory on human agency and the physical body for the purpose of emphasizing the unequivocal necessity of respecting sex workers' autonomy, first and foremost, in any future determination of sex work's place within the social and legal fabric of the country. <em>Canada; Canadian law; commercialization of sex; federal government; language; law; legislative history; prostitution; sex workers; victim’s rights; women; women’s bodies.

Charlotte Stevens (2010); Supervised by Jennifer Brayton</p> <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> The practice of vidding, making a music video that uses existing media as source material, is relevant to a contemporary study of television and audience studies. Media fandom has a long history of embracing advances in consumer technology to interact with the objects of their fandom, but vids and vidding have enjoyed only limited scholarly attention. This thesis uses a case-study of three vids made from episodes of Doctor Who, supported by textual and visual analysis, and an examination of the nature of fandom and fan production, to explore the critical narratives constructed in the selected vids and to demonstrate one of the subcultural results of media piracy. Through an analysis of the making and re-making of meaning in fanvids, I extend Barthes's explanation of the semiotic function of captioning to describe the analysis performed by the interaction of lyrics to video clips. <em>Multimedia Communications; sociology; mass communications Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Out of the heavily politicized atmosphere of 1960s America, what can be considered some of the most socially poignant popular music of the twentieth century was created. In order to demonstrate the socio-political functions of popular music, and examine the effects that co-optation had on the spread of this music and its message, I conducted an ethnographic content analysis of the Billboard Top 40 popular music charts from 1957-1972. With such statistical data I traced the presence of socially conscious songs on the charts in order to demonstrate how the socially significant music of this era in fact spread to larger, more mainstream segments of the population. Furthermore, I have also offered a refreshing alternative for examining the concept of co-optation, which will open new doors into further research done by other academics. <em>American studies; Cultural anthropology; Music; Mass communications; Communication and the arts; Social sciences </em></p> </td>

Although this shift apparently stems from noble intentions, the image of the 'vulnerable refugee' has stripped refugees of agency and expressive rights. The photographs published by The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has employed this vulnerability frame in order to lobby for western aid by presenting an easily digestible discourse, congruent with Western ideology. The UNHCR has thus commodified refugees in order to ensure funding from western donors. This paper challenges this commodification by presenting a comparative analysis of the UNHCR's historical photographs, and images produced through a participatory photography project conducted in the Kenyan Kakuma Refugee Camp. This project shifts the conventional illustrative refugee discourse by identifying and rejecting the political and economic frameworks that have institutionalized the voiceless and commodified refugee.&nbsp; <em>Kenya; Kentan Kakuma Refugee Camp; photography; refugee; refugee commodification; refugee protection; United Nations.

Theoretical framework underlining this study is a discourse on visual representation of female Muslim characters, hybrid construction of gender, religious values, and media consumption. The primary research questions of this study are; (1) How do Muslim tween girls reproduce meaning and construct gender identity in their creative works? (2) How do their stories intersect gender construction with their religious background and media consumption? The results of this study revealed the hijab (Muslim head scarf) as significant visual representation of female Muslim characters in young adults’ stories. It affirms hybrid representation of gender, religious and media consumption which, in turn demonstrates Muslim tweens mitigation in gender construction. This study also reveals the fluidity of domination which explores aspects such as new context of non-existent male-characters, religious identity and kindness as the indicator of perceived beauty. Additionally, some of these tweens associate feminine identity and representation with nature which is deeply rooted in Western fairy tales and religious values (Judeo-Christian and Islam). <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

The genesis of the show grew from the curators' desire to engage in the ongoing debate around the collision between past and present that was to be so conspicuously manifested in the Daniel Libeskind-designed postmodernist extension to the ROM. It was a timely opportunity to exhibit some of the groundbreaking work coming from some of Canada's contemporary artists, particularly in the context of the museum, which maintains a traditional approach to Indigenous arts and cultures.

Her style of writing has been referred to as "equal parts gossip, kinky sex and high theory." Her stylistics have been eagerly digested according to the tenets of postmodern discourse while her protagonists are held up as proof of her generation's rage against "control societies." The transgressive sexuality enacted in her texts, including sexual masochism, sexual violence and self-mutilation, is frequently interpreted as anarchic attempts to circumvent this logic. I purport to show that these tactics do not, in fact, spring from a reactionary politics. Rather, Acker is attempting to convey an abject carnal sexuality that struggles for expression within the name-of-the-father logic that structures conventional language and a lack of alternative feminist propositions. <em>feminism; French feminism; gender and sexuality; Kathy Acker; literary criticism; linguistics; queer theory; translation.

After establishing a multiperspectival framework for a discourse analysis of Lonely Planet Cambodia, this paper identifies a relationship between discursive constructions of tourist destinations, contemporary mobility practices and power. This relationship is reflected in a number of significant observations brought forth through critical analysis of the guide: First, in resemblances between LP Cambodia's articulatory practices, dominant trends in touristic representation and popularized Western conceptions of the nation. Second, in the guide's consistent articulation of favorable themes and a subsequent disarticulation or silencing of competing signifiers. And third, in LP Cambodia's tendency to display photographic images that reinforce existing impressions of Cambodia at the expense of more nuanced, relational and mutually gratifying modes of representation. Together, these observations evidence a pressing need for scholars to reconceptualize the way cross-cultural relations are theorized, practiced and understood. <em>Mass media; Communication and the arts Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Ultimately, I draw conclusions related to the current status of hip-hop in Canada, and suggest that the genre's dominant contestations are centred on the lack of definition of the Black, White and Native Canadian identity, ownership, and how corporate annexation impedes the genre's ability to transcend. <em>authenticity; Canada; Canadian hip-hop; Canadian rappers; consumerism; corporatization; female hip-hop communities; gender and sexuality; identity; national identity; race; regional identity; resistance rhetoric; slang vernacular; Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Written as a piece of per formative scholarship, this paper outlines the creative process of the author's project, and the theatrical history, theory, and methodology behind it. Fishnets &amp; Desire is a reflection of performance and queer theories, meditating upon the specific art forms of burlesque striptease and drag, and how they enact gender performativity. Neoburlesque is a tongue-in-cheek and satirical form of expression, which lampoons gender stereotypes, and societal expectations. The current art form draws upon cultural nostalgia for the kitsch of burlesque striptease that was performed in theatres, and gentleman's clubs from the 1920s-60s. Through the use of comedic exaggeration and hyperbolic gender presentation, burlesque seeks to undermine conventional notions of femininity, and deconstruct them. The author's performance piece also sought to engage with the energetic relationship between the audience and the burlesque performer's reciprocal gaze; and neoburlesque as a genre of carnivalesque spectacle. As an integration of live performance, projected video, and photography, Fishnets &amp; Desire created a space in which the audience simultaneously experienced the feeling of being on stage, as well as actively watched (and thus, participating in) a burlesque striptease. <em>art installation; burlesque; burlesque striptease; carnivalesque spectacle; drag; creative process; gender performativity; gender stereotypes; neoburlesque performance; performance; queer theory.

A study was devised where forty-two children in grades four and five participated in a visual art workshop where they created a drawing and an accompanying story. In addition, the children were provided with three different technologies through which to record their stories: handwriting, dictating and typing. The children were required to produce a sample handwritten story for comparison to those written with one of these technologies. Results indicate that although children reported being motivated to communicate through visual art and alternative writing technologies, the stories created after the workshop and assessed by a teacher-developed rubric were significantly worse than the sample stories and the expected performance levels of the provincial Education and Accountability Office (EQAO). Reasons for this outcome could be that children lack experience communicating through alternative means, and that they are more concerned with the technicalities of authorship such as spelling, grammar and formatting in their drawings and writing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; <em>alternative writing technologies; children; storytelling; technology; visual art; writing processes; writing theory.

Emin applies certain feminist notions as she continues the motif of the reclining nude, offering semiotic gestures that indicate evidence of the body rather that the body itself. My Bed is the site of trauma and disgust, with all of the abjection left intact, and above all, a self expressionist piece documenting her personal trauma. The expressionist qualities harkens back to cultural discourse of hysteria, reinforcing the legitimacy of the feminist lens. Hysteria is a performance that Emin represents through confessing her traumatic history. Like the archetypal reality television star, she confesses personal emotions and histories, but breaks the status quo by offering an alternative representation with the abjected authenticity of the bed. <em>abject; affect; art history; body; feminism; feminist artists; gender and sexuality; gendered trauma; hysteria; My Bed (1998); performativity; Tracey Emin.

A discursive trajectory of the way in which the concept of a 'national citizen' in Toronto has been constructed and heralded through television is imagined from the first major televisual event in Toronto (the Coronation broadcast of Queen Elizabeth II, 2 June 1953), to the present moment when ambient television comprises a part of Toronto's spatial landscape. The findings of this dissertation suggest that changes to the televisual apparatus and the content of the dramas over fifty years make observable perceived tensions between 'the citizen' and 'the nation' within a trajectory of increasing skepticism toward the nation building project. <em>Mass media; Motion pictures; Communication and the arts; Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; City life; Nation; Televising; Urbanity Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Female salonnieres have been influential, yet often forgotten, figures of modernist art institutions. They used their financial and economic clout to help reshape political and economic social structures. Their example also allows us to study the ways in which finances either limited or allowed women to shape social structures, while proving the importance of their salons within the modernist era as a public sphere and as a space to challenge traditional gender roles. Thus, they helped shape the political and economic dimensions of the future art market. <em>art; artistic representation; consumer culture; cultural agency; female artists; Florine Stettheimer; gender economy; gender and sexuality identities; Gertrude Stein; Natalie Clifford Barney; poetry; political economy; Romaine Brooks; salon; salon culture; salonnières.

The cyberpunk movement in American SF that first took shape in literary fiction has parlayed into the visual story-telling scene, reflecting a new perspective on technology, popular culture and consumerism. This study, which is located within the postmodern paradigm, presents an argument for the potential of this new cycle of popular speculative cinema to render the experience of postmodernity, and display through images how the current Western capitalist power apparatuses might be disrupted in favour of social and cultural progress. Through a critical analysis of five mainstream cyberpunk films released between 1983 and 2006, the essay investigates how the cyberpunk genre identifies ironically with a mostly apolitical popular American SF cinema to produce a more radical cinema of resistance that breaks with conventional modes of representation. <em>Film studies; Communication and the arts </em></p> </td>

Of particular interest and equally important is the effort to provide a theoretical foundation for the conceptualization, operationalization, and empirical testing of the entertainment value concept, adopting the perspective of those experiencing performance-based and screen-based entertainment. This dissertation is also a crossover study between and among amusement, recreation, entertaining experiences, audience research, and events and live performances. Results will be integrated into the broader study of entertainment, where the core phenomenon under investigation is the entertainment experience. Entertainment value is a multi-faceted concept, widely used but poorly, or at least not effectively, operationalized for use in scholarly and commercial research. It is proposed herein that entertainment value refers to the type of value that screen-based products and live performances yield to those who experience these generic forms of entertainment. Entertainment value is perceived consumer value, experiential and subjective, a multi-dimensional concept and construct intrinsic to the entertainment experience. In three complementary studies, respondents are grouped based on shared subjective experiences resulting from the consumption of three different kinds of innovative entertainment products: a) an animated, short documentary film, b) one episode a described video television comedy; and c) a live cultural performance. In an innovative way, Stephenson’s Q Methodology (1953) and Typology of Consumer Value proposed by Morris Holbrook (1999) are adopted, tested and refined to empirically identify, describe and compare the subjective viewpoints of those who experience entertainment. The Q Methodology allowed for a rich description of a range of entertainment experiences from almost three hundred respondents. Interpretation of subjective reactions and self-reports, and the differences among these viewpoints, have been facilitated by and pointed to corresponding types of perceived entertainment value. In this sense, Holbrook’s (1999) typology for consumer value proved useful, by complementing in a number of ways the design and implementation of this exploratory research with Q methodology. <em>consumer value; entertainment experience; entertainment value; performance-based entertainment; screen-based entertainment; subjective experience.

Drawing on Doreen Massey’s (2005) proposal that space must be seen as the product of constant interrelations, I argue that dystopian literature can similarly prompt us to reconsider our relationship to the spaces we inhabit. Using the concept of the “critical dystopia,” I examine how dystopian frameworks are operationalized in the Canadian context through a comparative analysis of two novels that speculate distinctly Canadian dystopian futures: Larissa Lai’s Salt Fish Girl (2002) and M.G. Vassanji’s Nostalgia (2016). By applying Massey’s theorization of space—its multiplicities, complexities, and political potentialities—to an examination of how Canadian spaces are transformed in the dystopian context, I then analyze how those representations challenge the spatial ideologies associated with globalization, and resist the neoliberal view of space as a surface to be crossed and conquered (Massey, 2005). <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

This thesis proposes to dissect the current practice of online journalism as a means to understanding the current predicament in which journalism finds itself. And, while many news organizations and journalists herald the rise of online news as a major, positive revolution within the industry, this form of journalism is fraught with contradictions and shortcomings. This thesis seeks to explore the cogency behind the arguments surrounding journalism online and critique those in an effort to better understand its current state. This thesis proposes a new direction in an effort to wrestle with some of the persistent problems facing modern journalism through a practice called E-journalism, which seeks to create a form beyond much of the journalism done online over the past 15 years, as a means of reconnecting with a socially responsible practice to enhance a participatory democratic system. <em>Journalism; Communication and the arts </em></p> </td>

This value, I will argue, comes from a combination of subjective, sensorial contemplation, nostalgic yearning, and a reaction to the spatial fragmentation and temporal acceleration of contemporary North American life. In order to bridge the gap between academic discourse and personal narrative, I will apply the theories on memory by Pierre Nora and Andreas Huyssen and on nostalgia by Svetlana Boym to the conversations in the video component of my project about the current fascination with mid-century objects. While the style of the 1950's and 60's could simply be an aesthetic trend, moving to other periods in a few years, perhaps the narratives that surround the mid-century period speak to busy, young people today because of a deeper cultural yearning for postwar ideals like quality and domesticity. <em>affect; Andreas Huyssen; documentary; domestic sphere; everyday life; filmmaking; melancholy; memory; myth; mid-century objects (1946-1964); nostalgia; Pierre Nora; sensory experiences; Svetlana Boym; video Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

It uses Madonna as a case study because she is such a clear example of the agency of celebrity across the media apparatus, the processes of bringing a product to the marketplace and the ongoing negotiation of power and meaning through audience practices. This dissertation explains how Madonna has achieved, negotiated, and maintained her success in the culture industry by outlining her relationship to her record company and larger media corporation. Given that power is not a straightforward mapping of dominant ideologies through cultural productions I contend that there are particular methods for negotiating power relations and bringing subversive content to mainstream culture. Madonna's success as a celebrity follows larger patterns of commodification including the primacy of the visual and the importance of packaging. In particular, Madonna's commodified female body acts as product packaging and is subject to market preference for youth and prejudice against aging adopting larger commercial ruling catchphrases such as "best before" and "expiry" date. Additionally Madonna's pattern of reinvention follows larger models of reinvention applied to commercial products from dish soap to roller blades in order to revitalize her commodity package from album to album and video to video. This dissertation explores the symbiotic relationship between celebrities such as Madonna, the larger media corporations, the production of particular cultural texts and audiences' meanings and practices. It does so in an effort to surpass some of the limitations of previous Madonna scholarship which focused solely on identity politics through formalist readings of cultural texts and their reception to explore the influence of the larger political economic, historical, and cultural contexts of capitalist society. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

This investigation presents an opportunity for re-evaluating the importance of physical touch as an embodied and subjective mode of experience, which is often overlooked in our visuallybiased cultural landscape. The emergence of ubicomp enables the physical world of tactile objects and environments to become a medium for digital interaction. This ongoing technological development resonates with the pre-modern definition of media as environments that produce and sustain existence (Peters, 3), foregrounding not only materialist but also ontological aspects of media, erasing the boundary between the virtual and the physical, the technological, and the natural. The environmental approach to media studies finds its origin with The Toronto School of communication theory, starting with Eric Havelock and Harold Innes, and was further developed by Northrop Frye and Marshall McLuhan. The area was subsequently coined by Neil Postman as “media ecology” (Gencarelli, 201). <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Whitehead (2012); Supervised by Paul Moore</p> <p><strong>Major Research Paper:</strong> "Who Will Be Ruth?" was a headline that dominated small town newspapers from 1915-1918. This headline corresponded with a contest that targeted young women to participate in the new national pastime of cinema by having local women vie for the roles in a film with citizens voting for their favourite woman to play the lead character of Ruth. The "Who Will Be Ruth?" contest became a local phenomenon, which garnered tens of thousands of votes in each town the contest ran. The contest exemplifies the film contest trend that occurred in newspapers from 1911-1918, which elicited audience participation in the creation of film content. Movie contests reveal an early participatory culture, which contradicts critical theory's notion of a passive audience. Mass produced cinema in fact actualized publics that participated in the creation of the very content they consumed. The formation of movie fans can be studied by exploring early participation in collective practices, as reflexive circulation of discourse is integral to the creation of a public (Warner, 2002). My research involves studying three distinctive film contests that demonstrate the historical process of creating fandom through the use of newspaper texts. The transformation of film into American mass culture in the 191 Os is directly connected to fan groups who were largely made up of female fans who both legitimized film going and created a distinctive fan public. Film contests gave women agency in creating content for mass culture before voting rights were universal. An exploration of movie contests from 1911-1918 will provide new insights into the relationship between participatory cultures, aesthetic objects and discourse. <em>celebrity; cinema; fan discourse; fandom; female audience; female representation; movie star; news media; photoplay contests; popular culture; publics.

This approach is embedded in a history of US-led liberal order building, in which liberal principles and democracy are deployed strategically as mechanisms which not only create political and economic freedoms in previously authoritarian polities, but also limit the contours of social life in ways that are constitutive of US hegemony. Mass media development and use are a part of this conflicted process, providing both an architecture for delimiting the opportunities for political engagement by the bulk of the citizenry and a tool for managing the perceptions of the population in a manner that is congruent with US purposes. This thesis draws on previous research and relevant contemporary policy and practice to elucidate how the US approach to the Afghan mass media environment has functioned to foster liberal order between 2001 and 2010. I map the ways in which current US mass media policy and practice hinder the potential emergence of radical-democratic forms of citizen engagement in order to inform potential ways forward. <em>International Relations; Mass communications; Social sciences; Communication and the arts; 2010; United States </em></p> </td>

Specifically, it is concerned with how the power to promote ideas about policy issues may enhance the ability of people and organizations with that power to influence the policy development process. Although the policy communities approach claims to account for power differentials, it adopts a liberal view of the media that understands media organizations primarily as neutral intermediaries in the policy process. This failure to acknowledge issues of power in regard to communication represents a serious flaw in the policy communities approach---a flaw that renders the approach's usefulness for dealing with issues pertinent to media organizations questionable. To demonstrate this problem, an investigation is conducted into how the approach deals with an extremely salient issue for media organizations---communications policy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Through this evaluation, the policy communities approach is shown to contain theoretical problems regarding the conception of media organizations and questionable assumptions about news media content.

A content analysis identifies whether a peacekeeping or a war discourse was dominant in press representations of the Canadian Forces' missions in Afghanistan, and a critical discourse analysis is conducted to consider the various ways that the mythology of peacekeeping is manoeuvred. It finds that the myth is both celebrated and denigrated, helping to legitimise the foreign military presence in Afghanistan, at the same time as contributing to a discursive shift in the way that the Canadian Forces is represented. The research suggests that a war order of discourse has been interspersed throughout such news coverage contributing to an overall shift in the dominance of the peacekeeping myth in relation to the Canadian Forces. <em>Journalism; Mass communications; Military studies; Communication and the arts; Social sciences </em></p> </td>

This was no run-of-the-mill, watch-the-paint-dry policy hearing. Tempers and passions flared as two industry titans, over-the-air (OTA) broadcasters, such as CTV and Canwest Global, and broadcast distribution undertakings (BDUs) such as Shaw Communications, Bell Canada and Rogers Inc. fought the battle of their lives over an issue called fee-for-carriage (FFC). The media covered the issues day in and day out. Canadians bombarded the CRTC with dose to 200,000 comments and the Government of Canada forced the CRTC to hold an additional hearing just to address the impact the decision could have on the public. With extensive media coverage and uncharacteristically active public participation, could this public policy process be deemed 'democracy in action'? This paper will argue that this is not the case. Through a discourse analysis of the debate within two distinctly differentiated public spheres -- 1) the battling media campaigns and 2) the CRTC public hearings in November and December of 2009 -- this paper will show that the public's ability to define its own interest, using its own voice, is tarnished to such a severe degree that this policy process fails. <em>Canada; Canadian Broadcasters; Canadian broadcasting policy; Canadian Ratio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC); consumerism; fee-for-carriage; mass media; public policy; public sphere; value-for-signal.

Graphic counter-memorial comics address history, memory, and trauma as they depict the political, violent, and collective aspects of war and social conflict. I argue that the particular comics I study in this dissertation, which mingle fiction and non-fiction and autobiography as well as journalism, follow the tradition of the counter-monuments described by James E. Young. Studying commemorative practices and counter-monuments in the 1980s, Young notes a generation of German artists who resist traditional forms of memorialization by upending the traditional monument structure in monument form. Young looks at the methods, aims, and aesthetics these artists use to investigate and problematize practices that establish singular historical narratives. Like these works of public art, the graphic counter-memorial asks the reader to question ‘official history,’ authenticity, and the objectivity typically associated with non-fiction and reporting. I argue that what these comics offer is an opportunity to re-examine comics that incorporate real and familiar social and historical events and wars. Comics allow creators to visually and textually overlap perspectives and time. Graphic counter-memorials harness the comic medium’s potential to refuse fixed narratives of history by emphasizing a sense of incompleteness in their representation of trauma, memory, and war. This makes possible a more complex and rich way to engage with Western society’s relationship to the past, and in particular, a more complex way of engaging with collective memory and war. Their modes of mediating history produce political intervention through both form and content. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>

Subjecting media coverage to a combination of content analysis and critical discourse analysis uncovers the presence of four appropriative themes of Asianness: (a) the supraethnic viability of Asianness; (b) the necessary defeat of Blackness; (c) the disallowance of anti-Asian sentiment; and (d) the presence of a helpful Black cohort. These themes are themselves given meaning by five racially magnetized frames that position Asian Americans in opposition to Blackness across multiple dimensions: (a) Asian Americans as model minorities; (b) Asian American men as emasculated; (c) Asian Americans as invisible; (d) Asian Americans as forever foreign; and (e) Asian and Black Americans as enemies. The results of this study suggest that Asian American men benefit from the appropriation of Blackness, but that this benefit is contingent upon their ability to uphold heterosexist, white supremacist ideologies. <em>Jeremy Lin; basketball; race </em></p> </td>

Given these complex objectives, student newspapers rarely meet expectations and thus suffer from low readership levels. Given that students are the primary audience, this paper examines the mandates of the student press from a student perspective. A sample of 432 York University undergraduate students was surveyed in order to understand what students expect from and what would encourage them to read student newspapers. Findings show that students' opinions of the student press closely align with traditional mandates that indicate student newspapers should foster notions of democracy and community-building. However, findings also indicate that the primary way to meet these expectations is to create a newspaper that primarily works to appeal to and attract students as readers. <em>Journalism; Mass media; Communication and the arts Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

To appreciate how Canadian corporations are now mandated to achieve progress towards employment equity, it is critical to its history, its incarnations and its impact on corporate Canada. Curiously, while there was a sizeable amount of quantitative and qualitative research endorsing legislated employment equity written prior to the initial Act, there is only a handful of academic research evaluating its success. Academic space devoted to employment equity has existed mainly as a sidebar in a more extensive analysis of other policies such as the key works of Judy Fudge, Anver Saloojee, Patricia McDermott and Annis May Timpson which appraise employment equity, but as a benchmark against which to compare to other policies such as child care and pay equity. Through a literature review of the primary and secondary documents, which respectively shaped and critiqued the Act's two manifestations as well as case studies of communications companies, I will show that this legislation - an example of social regulation in a neo-liberal era - was particularly effective once an audit component was added."--Page 3. <em>American policy; Canada; Canadian Policy; corporate Canada; employment equity; Employment Equity Act; environmental protection; fairness regulation; health and safety legislation; neoliberalism; social regulation; United States.

Movable type, small pieces of metal cast from an alloy of lead, tin and antimony, assembled into words and lines created pages that were inked then pressed into velum to create the printed word. This was the beginning of transmitted information, the mass production and distribution of small portable books. This thesis examines the evolution of printing from the Renaissance when “fixity” was achieved to its ascension to the first mass media. The research portion of the study observes, measures and compares the interpretive strategies that readers use when engaging with the printed page and how they adapt new strategies when reading online. Print and online stories from The Guardian, The Economist and The New Yorker were coded and used in the study. The study was conducted at Ryerson University. <em>magazines; news media; online news; print news; reading comprehension; reading processes; reading retention; screen-based media.

Rivaling the era's famous salons of Gertrude Stein and Nathalie Barney in Paris, collectively the sisters created a literary and artistic salon in which art making flourished. The distinctly feminine decor served as a backdrop for Florine's paintings on display in the salon; Ettie would describe the vibrant salon culture in her autobiographical and fictional writings; and Carrie's role as sartorial experimenter would be inscribed in the sisters' paintings and writings. <em>Stettheimer; Florine; 1871-1944; Stettheimer; Carrie Walter; d. 1944; Stettheimer; Ettie; Sisters in literature </em></p> </td>

Through in-depth interviews with 48 individuals active in the production of Canadian online scripted content, participant observation, and a benchmark quantitative analysis of gender and race in key creative roles in 175 seasons of Canadian web series, the dissertation investigates the web as an alternative space for Canadian scripted audiovisual content, and the actors and forces that have shaped and are shaping its development, including its emergent patterns of inclusion. By developing a novel theoretical framework that combines the critical political economy of communication with entrepreneurship studies, the dissertation is able to mediate effectively between structure and agency to reveal how Canadian web series creators are interpreting, internalizing and resisting larger institutional dynamics and discourses in their cultural practices and texts. Through their entrepreneuring, Canadian web creators are reacting to a variety of rigidities within the contextual dimensions in which they are embedded, including the absence of meaningful opportunities to practice their crafts, the persistence of networks of exclusion, and inaccurate or missing on-screen representations of themselves or others in mainstream media. Through their work, they desire to achieve freedom from these constraints. The challenge of disrupting the status quo is then revealed through an examination of the domestic and extra-national structural factors that act as impediments to their agency. The dissertation problematizes ideas of participation and access on the web, and introduces new conceptual terminology through the Participatory Culture Paradox, to encapsulate the contradictory set of relations that on the one hand, enables creators’ activities in the online space, and at the same time, constrains their capacity to find audiences and monetize their work. The findings here demonstrate that as much as internet-based distribution has expanded opportunities for participation for regular users, who you are, and where you are based, continue to be salient mediators of both participation and success in the development of professional scripted screen careers in the digital age. The dissertation culminates in actionable priorities for Canadian policy that aim at change. <em>&nbsp;Media and Culture</em></p> </td>

Within the last ten years, several films and television programs featuring gay men and lesbians have garnered critical acclaim and high ratings among diverse audiences and myriad companies have incorporated queer imagery into their advertising campaigns. Despite fervent protests from socially conservative organizations, this trend shows no signs of abating.-Introduction. <em>commodity capitalism; consumer culture; cultural visibility; gay and lesbian studies; heteronormativity; legal equity; popular culture; queer identities; queer theory; queer visibility.

This dissertation challenges pessimistic readings of Woody Allen’s film that render love difficult, if not impossible. By challenging assumptions about love, this dissertation opens a dialogue not only about the representation of love, but the understanding of love. Rather than a Platonic love of unity, this dissertation combines the phenomenological work of Luce Irigaray and Jean-Luc Marion to describe a love of letting be. A love of letting be focuses on the lived experience of love as a phenomenology. In a love of letting be it is the intent of both lovers to regard each other as an unknowable whole, whom they must support and whose mystery they must protect. The transformations of four characters from Allen’s cinema, Allan Felix of Play it Again, Sam, Alvy Singer of Annie Hall, Cecilia of The Purple Rose of Cairo, and Mickey Sachs of Hannah and her Sisters serve as illustrations of how coming to a love of letting be is possible. The four characters, the nervous romantics, come to understand a love of letting be through their experience in the cinema. Their experience in the cinema comes to enlighten their understanding and living of love as a love of letting be. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> </td>
