<div class="text"><p>The basis of admission to Ryerson’s undergraduate degree programs is the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), with six (6) Grade 12U/M courses including Grade 12 U English (one of ENG4U, ETS4U, EWC4U) or Anglais (one of EAE4U, EAL4U, EAC4U) (unless otherwise noted), plus program-specific prerequisite courses.</p> 
<p>The OSSD with a minimum overall average of 70 percent* in six Grade 12 U/M courses, or equivalent, establishes eligibility for admission; subject to competition, individual Ryerson programs may establish higher academic averages. All Ryerson programs also stipulate specific subject prerequisites. Applicants must successfully complete a minimum of one full secondary school course at the required level, or equivalent, in each of the subject prerequisites listed for the programs for which they wish to be considered. Grades required for admission are determined on the basis of competition.</p> 
<p>Applicants not educated in Ontario must submit evidence of education equivalent to the OSSD&nbsp; with six Grade 12 U or M courses. Minimum Canadian provincial requirements for admission are available for reference on the <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/admissions/canadian.html">Canadian Secondary School Students</a> webpage. Minimum international country requirements are published on the <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/admissions/international_edu.html">Internationally-Educated Students</a> webpage. Please note: Ryerson reserves the right to be the final arbiter of what will be accepted on an equivalency basis.</p> 
<p>An applicant’s complete academic record, including secondary school as well as all post-secondary studies (e.g. college, university, or other post-secondary institutions) will be reviewed and considered as part of the competitive selection process, unless otherwise noted. If applicable, applicants may wish to provide context for their academic achievement in their Supplementary Form. The Supplementary Form is available in the Supplemental Information section of the <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/apply/forms.html">Applications and Related Forms</a> webpage.</p> 
<p>Programs may also specify non-academic requirements for admission (e.g. portfolio, admission essay, interview, audition, etc.). These programs are referred to as Grades-Plus programs. The specific non-academic requirements for individual Grades-Plus programs, including specific submission dates and procedures, are available by visiting the individual <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/programs.html">Program pages</a>. Note: for Grades-Plus programs, both academic and non-academic criteria will be used in the admission selection process.</p> 
<p>Applicants are encouraged to achieve as much breadth of preparation as possible in the course of their studies while also meeting the stated subject prerequisite requirements of the program(s) to which they apply.</p> 
<p>* Ryerson receives more applications than spaces available. The averages/grades required for admission selection to each program is determined on the basis of competition each year. Possession of minimum averages and/or grades does not guarantee admission.</p>

<ul> 
 <li>All applicants to Grades-Plus programs in the Faculty of Communication and Design, and the Architectural Science program, are required to pay a Non-Academic Requirements Fee of $50 per program.&nbsp; The fee is paid at the time of submission of the Non-Academic Requirements.&nbsp; Please visit the applicable <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/programs.html">Program</a> page for details.</li> 
 <li>Applicants should note that the program offerings for both the winter and spring/summer terms are limited.&nbsp; Program availability can be verified on the <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/apply/programstatus.html">Program Accepting Applications</a> page.<br /> </li> 
 <li>Before completing either the OUAC 101, 105 or Ryerson Application the application instructions should be read carefully. Applicants should ensure they are selecting the correct program code(s) for their desired program choice(s); the codes are available in each online application.&nbsp; Applicants interested in part-time programs should ensure that they select the part-time option on the application form.&nbsp; Part-time programs are listed separately, after the full-time programs.<br /> </li> 
 <li>Applicants may review and change their completed application once it has been submitted. If any revisions to the OUAC application are made, Ryerson will be notified of the applicable changes shortly after the submission to the OUAC. Although all changes are important to the processing of each application, changes to program choice, surname, mailing, e-mail and home addresses are of significant importance and should be reported to the OUAC as soon as the situation arises.</li> 
 <li>Applicants who have applied via the Ryerson Application must notify Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment of any changes in application, address, e-mail, telephone numbers and/or other information as soon as they arise using the Ryerson Change Form, available on the <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/apply/forms.html">Applications and Related Forms</a> page.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br /> For applicants that have applied to Ryerson in a previous academic year: if the name on the application has changed in any way, proof of this name change (i.e. marriage certificate, notarized statement or other legal document) must be provided.&nbsp; Applicants must submit their legal name on the application; short forms or nick names should not be used.&nbsp; Applicants using the OUAC applications will be given the option to include their preferred name(s) in a separate field.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ryerson’s primary mode of communication is the Choose&gt;Ryerson portal and email.</strong><br /> <br /> All applicants are required to use a Choose&gt;Ryerson portal account (<a target="_blank" href="http://choose.ryerson.ca">choose.ryerson.ca</a>), and will be sent personal log in details to their email account after their application has been received. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Application status and applicant communications are viewable in the Choose&gt;Ryerson portal. Applicants must regularly monitor their Choose&gt;Ryerson account, and read all of the information that is posted to the 'My Application Status' and 'Documents' sections. Applicants are strongly advised to print and save all communications posted to their Choose&gt;Ryerson portal account.<br /> <br /> If an applicant’s email address changes, Ryerson must be updated immediately, through appropriate channels. Applicants should ensure that they have edited/updated their 'spam' filters to prevent important and time-sensitive e-mail communications from being filtered out as spam.<br /> <br /> NOTE: Changes (e.g. to application/amendments/condition extensions, etc.) may not be made verbally, either in person or by telephone. Most communication from Ryerson is date sensitive. Applicants who fail to respond within stated time frames may have their application or Offer of Admission cancelled.<br /> </p></div>

<div class="text"><p>It is the responsibility of all applicants to ensure that all required documents are received by Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment as part of the application process. Applications are not considered complete until the following are received:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Academic transcripts, including promotion/graduation status of the applicant’s complete educational background (secondary and all post-secondary studies). Academic transcripts must be submitted regardless if the program of study was successfully completed, or is relevant to the current application.<br /> </li> 
 <li>A completed Ryerson Supplementary Form (OUAC 101 applicants are not required to submit this form).<br /> </li> 
 <li>Non-academic requirements (i.e. portfolios, essays, etc.) as applicable.<br /> </li> 
 <li>English language proficiency test scores as required (see <a href="/undergraduate/admission/english.html" target="_blank">English Language Requirements</a>).</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br /> Academic transcripts must show the individual marks or grades achieved in each course or subject taken. Additional information regarding documents and academic transcripts can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/apply/documentsubmission.html">Submission of Documents</a> page.</p> 
<p>If applying for advanced standing admission (a level higher than first year/semester), course descriptions and teaching outlines of all post-secondary studies are generally not required at the time of application for admission (if this information is needed, a request will be forwarded by Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment).</p> 
<p>Course/teaching outlines may be required after admission has been granted when the student is applying for transfer credit. Course/teaching outlines are not kept once a transfer credit decision is made. Students are encouraged to keep a copy of all course/teaching outlines for their records.</p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>International students: Applicants are required to arrange for the submission of academic transcripts of all secondary and post-secondary studies (including promotion/graduation status), as well as school profile(s) including accreditation information and grading scale(s). Applicants must have already completed or be in the process of completing the minimum academic requirements at the time of application submission. If the documents are in a language other than English, applicants must also provide notarized literal English translations.</li> 
 <li>Ontario universities (including Ryerson) may require undergraduate applicants to have official international academic transcripts submitted directly to World Education Services (WES) Canada for verification as part of the admission process.&nbsp; Universities (including Ryerson) will directly notify applicants submitting international academic transcripts regarding specific submission requirements through WES Canada.</li> 
 <li>Proof of change of name (i.e. marriage certificate, notarized statement or other legal document) must be provided if academic documents show a name other than that under which an application is made.</li> 
 <li>Applicants who have indicated on their application that they are in Canada on a 'Study Permit' or 'Temporary Resident Visa' must submit a copy of their Visa authorization form or 'immigration papers' confirming this status.<br /> </li> 
 <li>Academic transcripts and all other supporting documentation submitted to Ryerson cannot be returned to the applicant.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All documents are routinely verified. Evidence of falsified documents during or after the admission selection process will result in the cancellation of an offer of admission and any/all program/course enrolments. Information on falsified documents is shared with member and affiliated institutions of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC).</p></div>

<div class="text"><p>Academic transcripts, Supplementary Forms, English proficiency test scores, and other supporting documents must be submitted to Ryerson University, Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment. Non-Academic Requirements must be submitted to the appropriate program department, or Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment, as per the instructions noted in the individual <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/programs.html">Program</a> pages.<br /> <br /> All necessary arrangements for submission of required documents should be made early to ensure documents are received by applicable deadlines.<strong> Ryerson will NOT send reminders requesting required documents.</strong><br /> <br /> Ryerson requires applicants to upload their documents, where applicable, via our <a target="_blank" href="/undergraduate/admission/apply/documentsubmission.html">Document Upload Page</a>. In extenuating circumstances, if applicants are unable to upload documents, they should be submitted by mail/courier to Ryerson University, Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON Canada M5B 2K3.</p> 
<p>All academic transcripts received via the Document Upload Page are considered <strong>unofficial</strong>. If offered admission, official academic transcripts must be provided as detailed in the Offer letter and sent using the OUAC Transcript Request Form, or by mail in a sealed envelope directly from the issuing institution. <strong>Maintaining an Offer of Admission will be dependent on the receipt and verification of official documents, in addition to meeting/fulfilling all other conditions stated in the Offer letter.</strong><br /> <br /> Ryerson University reserves the right to require official documents at any time during the application/admission process, and to rescind any Offer of Admission if discrepancies are found between unofficial and official documents.</p> 
<p><strong>Notes for OUAC Applicants:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Grades for current Ontario secondary school students will be submitted to the OUAC by their Guidance Office. It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that their Guidance Office, the OUAC, and that Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment at Ryerson are notified of any plans to upgrade/complete course(s) through night school, summer school, e-school or correspondence studies; and receive final grades for the course(s).</li> 
 <li>Applicants who are attending or have previously attended an Ontario university or college can request academic transcripts via the Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) Transcript Request Form (TRF). Some exceptions apply. See the OUAC Instruction Booklet for details.<br /> </li> 
 <li>Certain secondary schools in Ontario allow applicants to request official secondary school transcripts electronically (completed courses only) using an online service hosted by the Ontario College Application Service (OCAS). The OUAC has partnered with OCAS to offer this service to university applicants and it can be accessed from the Transcript Request section in the online OUAC 105 application. If the secondary school is not included in this online service, the secondary school must be contacted by the applicant to arrange for the submission of the official academic transcript.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To ensure documents are received by applicable deadlines, it is essential that applicants make all the necessary arrangements for the submission of required official academic transcripts prior to the deadline date stated in the Offer of Admission</p> 
<p>All statements on the application must be correct and complete. Applicants withholding, misrepresenting or failing to provide information are liable to have their application/enrolment cancelled. The disclosure or discovery of previously withheld or not-submitted transcripts/documentation will cause immediate cancellation of admission and application. Disclosure or discovery arising after course enrolment, registration or at any time as a current student is considered Academic Misconduct as per the <a target="_blank" href="/senate/policies/pol60.pdf">Academic Integrity policy</a>. The penalty arising from non-disclosure is de-enrolment and cancellation of admitted status regardless of academic progression at Ryerson.</p></div>

<ol> 
 <li>Ryerson will normally start to release offers of admission to Ontario secondary school applicants in late January or early February.</li> 
 <li>Non-Ontario secondary school students, including out-of-province high school applicants, may receive an Offer of Admission as soon as Grade 12 (or equivalent) interim marks are received by Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment at Ryerson and as soon as Ryerson has completed an assessment of the application.</li> 
 <li>Each year, Ryerson announces anticipated program-by-program first release dates. This information is available on the <a href="/undergraduate/admission/apply/after.html" target="_blank">After Applying</a> page. Ryerson will make every attempt to meet, but cannot guarantee, projected release dates.</li> 
 <li>In order to maintain their admitted status, an applicant must follow all instructions and meet all deadlines contained in supporting, post-admission documentation. This includes but is not limited to applicant confirmation of acceptance of the Offer by the stated deadline, compliance with admission conditions and tuition deposit dates, and finalization of a timetable during the University Enrolment period.</li> 
 <li>Ryerson reserves the right to withdraw Offers of Admission made to applicants who do not meet the condition(s) outlined in their Offer of Admission, who do not confirm their Offer of Admission by the specified confirmation date, or who do not pay their deposit/fee payment as required. As well, evidence of any falsified document(s) will result in the cancellation of an Offer of Admission or enrolment in a program.</li>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Courses used as basis of admission are not recorded as individual transfer credits and may not be used to apply for Transfer Credit. The original grades obtained in the courses used for advanced standing are not recorded as graded courses on the Ryerson academic record. Original grades are not used in the calculation of a student’s Grade Point Average.</p> 
<p><strong>Residency Requirement:</strong> Applicants admitted with advanced standing/transfer credits must complete, as a Ryerson student, studies that normally include at least one half of the program’s curriculum. No more than a total of 50 percent of the program’s requirements may consist of advanced standing/credits (transfer credits, challenge credits, credits granted on a Letter of Permission).</p> 
<p>Applicants applying for advanced standing/transfer credits must arrange to have one set of academic transcripts of their secondary and all post-secondary studies, including promotion/graduation status, submitted to Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment, unless otherwise noted. Transcripts for applicants who are currently attending a post-secondary institution must also include a list of courses in progress.</p> 
<p>If applying for advanced standing admission, course descriptions and teaching outlines of all post-secondary studies are generally <strong>not </strong>required at the time of application for admission (if this information is needed, a request will be issue by Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment). Course/teaching outlines may be required after admission has been granted, and when applying for transfer credit (see the <a target="_blank" href="/currentstudents/transfercredits">Transfer Credit</a>&nbsp; page for further details.)</p> 
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Students admitted into a degree completion/advanced standing program who wish to enrol in any Faculty of Arts course that has a prerequisite must first obtain permission from the appropriate teaching department. Students are required to provide the teaching department with a course outline and proof of completion of the appropriate prerequisite. &nbsp;</p></div>
